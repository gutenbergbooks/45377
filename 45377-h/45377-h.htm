<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE"></a>PREFACE</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">I am</span> told, it is indispensable there should be a
Preface to this little work; but I am quite at a loss
what to put in it. What I had to say on the subject
upon which it treats, I have said in the book, and I am
not aware of any thing I wish to add or withdraw. I
can only hope the perusal of the book may afford as
much pleasure to my readers as the writing it has
given me, in recalling pleasant memories of many
friends, both two and four-footed, some of whom have
long since "joined the majority." As recording the
impressions of one who has had considerable practical
experience with many varieties of the canine race, and
been brought into constant contact with the best specimens,
I think my book is somewhat out of the usual
run of doggy books. While in no wise seeking to produce
a scientific treatise, nor yet a natural history, in the
ordinary acceptation of the term, my wish has been so
to write on the subject as to stir up in the minds of
any of my readers, unacquainted with the many charms
possessed by dogs, a desire to adopt some kind of dog
as a companion and friend, and to confirm the affection
and regard of my multitudinous dog-loving friends, so
that they may be disposed to extend the borders of their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">[Pg iv]</a></span>
fancy, and possibly be interested and amused by some
of the humours and vagaries of the Show Rings or the
Doggy Anecdotes. These, when they are not within my
personal knowledge, I have endeavoured to verify, so
as to avoid the "Fairy Tales" we sometimes read
under the title of "Doggy Stories." Before closing
these remarks, I must express my deep gratitude, to my
friend Mr. R. H. Moore, who has given my book the inestimable
advantage of his talented pencil, in portraying
so many excellent, and truthful portraits of the
"Lights of the Canine World," including more than
sixty "Champions," of their respective varieties. I am
not aware that such a number of Canine Celebrities
has ever before been gathered together in one volume,
and they represent some of the best pictures of
dogs I have ever seen, even of Mr. Moore's, and, I
think most dog lovers will acknowledge that he is
particularly happy in hitting off the expressions, and
catching the actual likeness of his subjects, most
kindly taking up the matter for me, when very much
pressed with other commissions, not only giving me
the benefit of his valuable advice in the selection of the
most distinguished, and typical, specimens for the different
varieties procurable, but entered into the work
with the utmost ardour, and zeal; I feel therefore more
indebted to him than I can express, for enabling me to
present to the Public such an interesting and, I hope,
instructive Picture Gallery of Dogs of the present
day. With these few words I commend my little book
to the troublous waters of public favour.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v" id="Page_v">[Pg v]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="INTRODUCTION" id="INTRODUCTION"></a>INTRODUCTION</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">I suppose</span>, if we take the whole of the Animal Kingdom,
in any way associated with man, either as companion,
or helper, there is none to compare, in popularity,
with the subject of these notes; but yet I have
often found in conversation, even with lovers of animals,
very mistaken notions about dogs, their varieties,
characteristics and peculiarities. I think there are
more known and acknowledged varieties of dog, than
of any other of the animals, we are at all familiar with,
and the ways, sizes, appearance and characteristics
differ so greatly that it is hardly possible, one would
imagine, to find any person to whom <i>some</i> kind of a
dog would not appeal. I wish, if possible, to say something
to stir up in the minds of some not hitherto keeping
a dog, the desire to do so, and whether merely as a
guard or companion or with a view to trying to breed
some good specimens, and, occasionally, to send to
some of the Exhibitions of Dogs, which have so increased
in number and quality during the last twenty
years, that I have frequently heard it stated, that taking
out Saturdays and Sundays, there is a Dog Show
being held somewhere or other on every ordinary day
in the year!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[Pg vi]</a></span></p>

<p>I would strongly advise the obtaining a <i>well-bred</i>
dog, of whatever variety is selected, as, not only is it
more satisfactory to have about you the best procurable
type of any breed you may fancy, whether dogs or anything
else, but if you want to part with either the originals,
or any of their progeny, it is usually much easier
to find purchasers and at much better prices for what is
called "pedigree stock," that is of which the parentage
for one or more generations is known, than when no
particulars or references can be given.</p>

<p>There are fashions in dogs, the same as in other
things, and I can remember a great many "crazes" for
different breeds of dog. Fox Terriers, which are
smart, lively, game little fellows, well able to adapt
themselves to almost any circumstances, have had a
long term of favour, and are still largely kept, perhaps
as largely as any breed of their size; another element
in their favour, is their not having much coat, and
so not bringing in much mud upon them, even in
dirty weather, if kept in the house. This, of course,
has been rather against Skye Terriers, which are otherwise
capital dogs for the house, full of life and
spirit, but, to be kept in any order, they must be occasionally
brushed, or their coats, which should be hard
and straight, somewhat of the texture and straightness
of a horse's tail, will get matted, and be a disfigurement,
instead of an ornament.</p>

<p>A great movement has existed, for sometime, in favour
of the Irish Terrier, who should be almost unbroken
in reddish-brown colour, I mean with little or no
shading, what is called self colour. This is a "good all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[Pg vii]</a></span>
round" breed, able to follow a horse, a trap, be a good
guard or companion, take care of himself in his "walks
abroad," or have a turn at anything which comes in
his way in the vermin line.</p>

<p>Two more breeds I can strongly recommend to any
in doubt as to a suitable dog to take up as household
guard or companion. These are the Scottish Terrier,
often called the Die-hard, or Aberdeen-Terrier,
a rather cobby, short legged breed, with a pointed
head, ears standing straight up, short back, and
gaily carried tail, colour generally, nearly black, grizzled,
or brindled. I believe I brought, in 1868, the
first of the breed ever seen in England (at any rate I
had not seen one before), from a place called Uig,
in the island of Skye, and quite a character he was,
and I could give many instances of his great sagacity,
and very quaint ways, during the many years
he lived with me. I regret to say he has long gone to
the "happy hunting grounds." I shall say something
more of him amongst the "Anecdotes of Dogs," further
on.</p>

<p>The other breed I referred to is the Dandie Dinmont
Terrier, immortalized by Sir Walter Scott. For intelligence,
pluck, faithfulness, and general adaptability to
the ways, and wishes, of his owner, I do not know any
breed to surpass it. In many cases, I have known a
strain of Dandies kept up for generations, in families,
and the affection between the dogs, and their owners,
is so great, that no money would bring about a parting,
and I have often seen pedigrees and genealogical trees
of well known strains of Dandies, taking them back a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</a></span>
dozen generations, and prized very highly by their
owners or breeders.</p>

<p>Whatever the decision come to by an intending
keeper of a dog, if it is to be an inmate of the house,
and is one of the smaller breeds, a box or basket
should be provided in some place free from draughts,
and after sprinkling either a little sawdust impregnated
with disinfectant, or the disinfectant itself, put in some
straw for a bed, this is better and less likely to harbour
insect life, than hay, or any kind of rug, or mat.</p>

<p>But if the dog is to be kept out of doors, obtain one
of the improved kennels, with the entrance at the side,
which affords a shelter from the wind, rain, and snow,
and have a chain constructed with two or, preferably,
three swivels in it, that it cannot become twisted up.
Many a dog has been injured and even killed by neglect
of these little matters.</p>

<p>Of course, if convenience can be found, it is much
better <i>not</i> to tie up a dog at all. No dog of mine,
(and I have had hundreds during the last twenty-five
years, of almost every known breed) ever catches
sight of a collar or chain, except at a show, and, contrary
to the popular idea which I have often heard
expressed by sympathisers with the dogs on the show
benches, dogs accustomed to exhibition work <i>delight in
it</i>, and the sight of a dog's travelling box or basket, or
the rattle of a chain, with the show label on it, is sufficient
to cause the wildest excitement amongst my dogs
at any time, each dog hoping it may be his good fortune
to go to the show, which they look upon as great entertainment.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[Pg ix]</a></span></p>

<p>I will undertake to say, that, if a dozen boxes or
baskets are placed in the yard, with the lids open,
and as many dogs let out of their kennels, you shall
find an occupant in every box, within five minutes,
and that each shall choose the box he usually travels
in! It is far better to enclose your dog, or dogs,
in one of the many forms of loose boxes, or kennels,
now procurable of so many firms who cater for
dogs' requirements, something in the way of a kennel,
or sleeping box, with railed in run attached. One of the
neatest and best, at anything like the price, (ninety shillings,
if my memory serves me,) I have seen, is made
by Mr. William Calway, Sharpness, Gloucestershire,
who has made quite a leading article in his trade, of
this kind of work.</p>

<p>Another matter to be attended to is, to give the
dog plenty of exercise, unless the weather positively
prevents it. Many people seem to fancy, if a dog is
taken into the air, <i>in</i> a carriage, or other conveyance,
that this is sufficient, but, <i>it is not so</i>, and the
generality of dogs are all the better, for at least two
hours' walking exercise every day, during which time,
they will nearly, or quite, double the distance traversed
by their master or mistress, and perhaps get a
drink, pick up some grass, or otherwise amuse themselves!</p>

<p>As regards water, dogs do not drink so much as
many people suppose, and it is better to keep a supply,
of course frequently changed, in the yard outside
the kennel, or sleeping box. Dogs, as a rule, like a
drink when going out or returning from exercise, more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[Pg x]</a></span>
than they do in their own quarters, and if it be kept
there, particularly when two or more inmates are
together, it is almost sure to be upset, and make the
place look bad, besides being uncomfortable.</p>

<p>A very important matter is the feeding of the dogs.
In these days, when so many firms are producing biscuits,
on purpose to cater for the wants of the vast
doggy community, there is no difficulty in getting some
of them, but, I have found, in a long experience with
dogs, that, although almost all breeds will eat dog biscuits&mdash;some
even take them when given whole, and
chop them up like bones, <i>even dry</i>&mdash;it is better, in most
cases, to break them up, about the size of walnuts, and
soak them the day previously to use, in hot water, or
broth, or even cold water. If boiled vegetables, potatoes,
cabbage, or some such, be mixed with them afterwards,
it is not only more palatable, but better for the
dogs, than the biscuit alone, and occasionally, say once
in a week or ten days, a little flour of brimstone, in the
proportion of about a teaspoonful for a fair-sized dog,
should be mixed with the food.</p>

<p>We know, ourselves, that whatever our food, the
most tempting that money could buy, we should tire of
it, if always the same, and it is precisely the same with
animals, so that, the more it is varied, the better, even if
the change is slight, and all who have had much to do
with dogs, will know that some dogs, and even some
breeds of dogs, are very fanciful and capricious in their
appetites, and not always disposed to do well.</p>

<p>When dogs are "off their feed," a sheep's head,
boiled, and then broken up, and the bones, meat, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[Pg xi]</a></span>
broth mixed with their ordinary food, will generally
"fetch" the most dainty feeder; other dogs are very
keen on oatmeal porridge, made as for human beings,
but, of course, <i>with no sugar</i>, which I may say should
<i>never</i> be given, <i>in any form</i>, to dogs, as it is an unnatural
and injurious food for them, although they are
usually quite willing to eat a lump of sugar at almost
any time, but they are <i>much better without it</i>. Milk
(unskimmed, otherwise it is likely to upset their stomachs),
is also a capital thing for dogs in low condition,
or out of sorts. It is best given cold, or lukewarm,
<i>after being boiled</i>, as in its natural state it is thought
liable to cause worms, but, of course, this is not always
the case. I have also found "bovril" useful as a
"pick-me-up," or appetizer, for animals on the sick list
or those who are "bad doers."</p>

<a name="CHAPTER_I" id="CHAPTER_I"></a>CHAPTER I</h2>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">A Few Words About Dogs in General</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">In these</span> days of progress, when the tendency of
everyone, and everything, seems to be to go ahead and
try to outdo all that has been done by everyone else,
in fact, as we so often see it termed, "to beat the record,"
I think I am stating only the actual fact, that, in
the history of the world, dogs were never so highly
thought of as they are now, nor were they ever so
catered for, in a variety of ways, nor so generally
popular.</p>

<p>And when we consider the many varieties of the
species, differing as much as is possible in the members
of one family, and the appearance, habits, dispositions,
uses and characteristics, just as various, it is not to be
wondered at that they enjoy such an amount of public
favour, as it must be a strangely constituted human
being to whom <i>no breed</i> of dog is acceptable!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span></p>

<p>The numerous packs of stag and foxhounds, harriers,
beagles, and other hounds, kept throughout the United
Kingdom, not only are the means of providing an immense
amount of sport for our countrymen, but are,
also, directly and indirectly the cause of the great improvements
which have been effected in the breed of
our horses, particularly those suited for hunters and
cover hacks, and, therefore, the cause, also, of the circulation
of a vast amount of money in our own country
every year, especially amongst farmers, millers, saddlers,
hay and corn dealers, trainers, keepers, kennelmen,
grooms, helpers and a large number of others,
more or less connected with hunting and its surroundings.</p>

<p>To take another branch of the same subject, just
consider what a large body of men are interested
and employed in the breeding, rearing, and training of
the vast number of high class greyhounds, which are
kept in some parts of the country, not only for the
competitions in the important national events, but, even
for private owners, who make a hobby of an occasional
trial with their dogs. Then again, the great army
of keepers, kennelmen, and gillies, kept throughout
the kingdom, to look after and, in some cases, to breed,
and break, the deerhounds, pointers, setters, retrievers,
and spaniels, which add so much to the pleasure of a
true sportsman's daily work amongst game of all kinds,
from deer-stalking to shooting black-cock, grouse, partridges,
pheasants, etc. (although many persons now-a-days
seem to go on the principle of getting a big total
of the days, or weeks' "shoot," and care little for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
real pleasure of seeing the dogs "work," and do credit,
or otherwise, to care and attention devoted to their
training), obtain employment, and I have found them,
as a rule, a highly respectable class of men, often generations
of the same family being in the service of one
family, and most jealous of the reputation of the
master, his dogs, and covers.</p>

<p>To take some of our other utility dogs, those of my
readers who have visited the cattle market of any large
sized town or city, cannot have failed to notice the dogs
which attend the professional drovers there, many of
them rough looking enough, in all conscience, but, as
for intelligence, why, they are brimful of it, and willing
and able to do wonders with the cattle and sheep in the
open, or on the road afterwards, understanding the few
words said to them, and eager to carry out their orders,
and although sometimes erring through <i>excess</i> of zeal,
the reverse is seldom the case, and I am pleased to say
(as I have known and conversed with many of the men
who are acquainted with my love for animals, and
know what numbers I have bred and owned), that the
greater part of them value their dogs, and appreciate
their services, so much so, that what might be considered
really big offers, have frequently been refused
by them. One of them said to me, "What good, sir,
for me to take a ten pound note for 'Bess,' I couldn't do
nothing without she, and 'twould take me a doose of a
time to make another larn to do like she can, with the
beasts, and that, let alone her being such a 'pal,' and
my missus, she <i>do</i> think a deal of Bess, to be sure sir."</p>

<p>I have no doubt, that a great many varieties of dog<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
have been pressed into the service of the many and
some highly accomplished troupes of performing dogs,
which the great increase of music halls throughout the
kingdom as well as the continent have brought forward.
I have at different times seen Great Danes,
Scotch Deer Hounds, Dalmatians, Poodles, and many
members of some of the Terrier and Spaniel families
and hosts of undoubted mongrels taking part in these
entertainments, as well as occasionally Greyhounds and
Collies, but these were, I think, exclusively engaged in
jumping competitions, when a sort of steeplechase was
arranged. These come under the category of "utility
dogs," as they assist their owners in gaining a living,
and the same may be said of the blind men's dogs,
which are a great multitude, and enjoy freedom from
taxation, on the ground of their value to their helpless
owners.</p>

<p>Another interesting class of utility dogs are those
we see at so many of our railway stations and
other public places with a small box hanging under
their chins, in which may be placed any donations the
charitable are disposed to give to the "Railway Servants'
Benevolent Association," or some other charitable
object, and from the way the animals run up to
passengers, to be noticed, and wait, patiently, while a
coin is found, and placed in their boxes, gives one the
idea they know what is going on, and that the credit
of a "good haul" at the end of the day, will be in
some measure reflected on the carrier of the collecting
box! I have often been surprised to see mentioned,
in the newspapers, the large sums a single dog has been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
the means of gathering, in this way, for some good
object, and, for aught I know, there may have been
dogs hard at work, during 1898-9, for "The Prince of
Wales's Hospital Fund," or other charitable objects!</p>

<p>One use to which dogs were formerly put, as "Turnspits,"
and another as beasts of burden, I am pleased
to say are no longer allowed by law. I have often,
when a child, seen them employed in the latter capacity
in the West of England, drawing small, usually two-wheeled
carts, with not only the usual market stock
and trade utensils, but sometimes the owner, in shape
of a burly man or woman seated on the top, and not
unfrequently racing along country roads with the owners
of similar vehicles, often with two or three dogs to
each, harnessed in tandem fashion, the noise and excitement
of the cavalcade being very great, and announcing
their approach long before their coming in
sight. I am very pleased that both these abuses of
dogs have been abolished here, although as beasts of
burden they are still extensively employed on the continent
of Europe, and, I am bound to say, I have not
seen them ill treated, badly fed, or seeming neglected.</p>

<p>Of course, we know that in the Arctic regions dogs,
as carriers, are actual necessaries, and that locomotion,
difficult and dangerous enough there under any circumstances,
would be simply impossible without the
aid of the Esquimaux dogs, of which I have seen a
good deal, and handled many. They have a dense
double coat, are very wolf-like in expression and shape
of head, with small, pointed ears, oblique, sly-looking
eyes, rather long, arched necks, and tails with char<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>acteristic curl and carriage. I do not consider them very
sociable, but they would, I dare say, be all right with
persons they knew well. I fancy they are a breed that
has never been "made much of," (particularly in their
native lands,) by their owners, but usually get what is
popularly known as "more kicks than halfpence," and
when "off duty," have often to go on short commons,
or do a little cadging on their own account, and being
thrown on their own resources, we know (on the authority
of the late immortal "Mr. Weller, Senr." evidenced
in the case of his well known son "Sam!") has
a great tendency to sharpen the wits, and it is the same
with the Esquimaux dogs, who always struck me as

<p><i>The Staghound.</i>&mdash;This is not a hound that will require
a long dissertation from me. There are but few
packs in England which hunt the deer at all, and still
less that hunt the <i>wild</i> deer; these are commonly supposed
to be the same as were formerly called "Southern
Hounds," and as the large tracts of land formerly
waste and forest have been gradually brought under
cultivation, the places most available for stag hunting
have disappeared. They were celebrated for "tongue,"
and made plenty of music as they followed the windings
of the deer, but they were not even moderately
fast hounds, and it is a fact, that no very fleet hounds
can be musical. Devon, which has always been a
great country for sport, has, for many years, kept up
a pack of Staghounds, besides others, as we find "Nimrod"
states "although the going in that county is
about the worst in the world, more hounds are kept in
Devon than in any three counties in England. In
1849, Devon possessed eight established packs of Foxhounds,
three of other hounds, the Staghounds, and
many a 'Parish Pack' kept by subscription." The
general run of Staghounds appear, both in shape, style<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
and colour, like large Foxhounds, and are commonly
supposed to be formed from drafts from the Foxhounds
too large for those packs. The modern Staghound
is about twenty-four inches high, or more; they
are seldom so level in colour, shape, or kennel likeness,
as you see in first-class packs of Foxhounds and Harriers.
The Royal Buckhounds are an exception; they
are kept in sound condition, and the best matching pack
in the kingdom, of the prevailing hound colours, including
every marking, except the blue mottle, thought
to be indicative of the "Harrier cross." The various
colours need not be set out here, nor is it necessary, in
a breed so seldom shown, to give the points of excellence
more fully than to say that great muscular
strength, plenty of bone, courage, excellent scenting
powers, and speed, are indispensable, as the quarry
hunted is usually in as fine condition as a race-horse,
and nearly as fast, often has been out before on a similar
occasion, knows the country well, and means giving
his pursuers what is vulgarly termed "a run for their
money!" Still, it must be admitted, unlike the packs
of all nations in the middle ages, the Staghounds of
our times are well disciplined and steady, and the stag
is more fairly hunted than he was, even in the reign
of Queen Elizabeth, so often described, (although I
am bound to say I am not included amongst her admirers)
as "Good Queen Bess!"</p>

<p><i>The Foxhound.</i>&mdash;I do not propose to go very deeply
into the history of this well-known and highly popular
breed, or enter into its supposed origin, about which
<span class="pagenum hide"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span><span class="pagenum hide"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>there is so much difference of opinion. When one
remembers the great number of packs of Foxhounds
in the United Kingdom, supported either by private
enterprise (like that of the late lamented Duke of
Beaufort, K. G., who, for such a number of years, bore
the burden of providing sport, over a large area, in the
West of England, four and five days a week throughout
the hunting seasons; in later years so ably seconded
in his efforts by his son, the present Duke,) or by subscription,
we cannot fail to recognise the fact, that this
breed of dog has done much to keep sportsmen in
touch with each other in our land, been the means of
circulating a vast amount of money in a great many
directions, and had a very important influence on the
breeding of Hunters and Coverhacks, for which the
United Kingdom holds such a high reputation. Beckford,
who has been considered one of the highest authorities
on hunting, says:&mdash;"Without taking upon me
to describe what requisites may be necessary to form a
good Prime Minister, I will describe some of those
which are essentially necessary towards making a perfect
Huntsman; qualities which, I will venture to say,
would not disgrace more brilliant situations, such as
clear head, nice observation, quick apprehension, undaunted
courage, strength of constitution, activity of
body, a good ear, and a melodious voice." In speaking
of the Foxhound, he goes on to say, "If he is not of
perfect symmetry, he will neither run fast, or bear
much work," and describes him as follows:&mdash;"Let his
legs be straight as arrows, his feet round, and not too
large; his chest deep, and back broad; his head small,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
his neck thin; his tail thick and brushy; if he carries
it well, so much the better. Such young hounds, as
are out at the elbow, or weak from the knee to the foot,
should never be taken into the pack. I find that I have
mentioned a "small head" as one of the necessary
points about a hound, you will please to understand it,
as relative to beauty only, for as to goodness, I believe
large headed hounds are in no way inferior. As to
colour, there is much diversity of taste; very often the
head and ears are of a brilliant red, or fallow, with a
white mouth and lips, and a streak of white, technically
known as a "blaze," down the head, a white collar and
chest, more or less black markings in blotches, or a
saddle on the body, and part of tail, white legs and
belly. The rich colour on head has a pleasing effect,
and if the cheeks are tan-marked, and there is the white
"blaze" before mentioned, it gives a light character to
the head, or, if orange is mixed with, and under, the
black markings, such would form "almost a perfect
combination of true hound colouring." I may, fitly,
conclude my few remarks on this interesting breed with
the following description of the desired points: The
head should be light, airy, sensible, and, at the same
time, full of dignity; it should have a certain amount
of chops, and the forehead slightly wrinkled. The
neck should be long and clean; the least looseness, or
throatiness, is fatal to appearance. Where it joins the
head, it should be fine, gradually widening to the
shoulders. A long neck is most important, in the
breed, as helping the scent, whereas, a short neck, not
only would impede action, but <i>pace</i>, also. The ears<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
should be close to the sides of the head and be set on
low. The shoulders, long, and sloping gracefully.
Chest deep, and not too narrow. The elbows well let
down, in a line with the body. The forelegs well
clothed with muscle, "straight as darts," strong in
bone from elbows to feet. The ankles, or pasterns,
must neither turn in, or out, nor stand back and should
be strong and large. The least tendency in the feet
"turning out," is most destructive to endurance and
pace, if any deviation from the straight line, they
should rather <i>turn in</i>. In shape, they should be round,
not flat, or fleshy. The divisions, between the toes,
should be apparent. The soles, firm, hard, and very
enduring. The back must be straight, wide, and muscular.
The loins strong, square and wide, with deep,
not flat, back-ribs. The hindquarters, very strong
and muscular, with wide appearance from behind, long
as well as large. Straight hocks, rather out than in,
with strong, short bone from hock to heel. The stern
should be gaily carried, should end in a fine point, little
feathered, but not actually smooth, strong at root,
gradually tapering to tips. Black, white and hound-tan,
is perhaps the best colour. When the black is very
prominent, and the tanned markings slight, the hounds
are said to be "black and white." When the colours
are mixed, they are said to be "pied." Hare, badger,
red, tan, and yellow-pies, are the best, in that order of
merit. The coat should be dense, although smooth
and glossy. The well-shaped foxhound seems, owing
to his well-proportioned frame, much smaller than he
really is. When thoroughly and closely examined, his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
beauty and fitness for the work he has to perform, and
the immense amount of speed, strength, courage, and
endurance, he so often requires, will be fully appreciated
by the observant spectator, even if he cannot be
strictly classed amongst "Sportsmen."</p>

<p><i>The Harrier.</i>&mdash;While I am writing these lines, I
have not the statistics before me, but I am certainly
under the impression there are not so many packs of
Harriers in the country as there formerly were. The
name of "Heirers," or Harriers is known to have been
given to hounds used for hare hunting in the time of
King Henry V., but they were also, occasionally used
for hunting deer! Before this, the same hound was
known as the Brachetis, or Bercelettus, the diminutive
from the word "Brache." The breed, in a more or
less coarse form, has, undoubtedly existed for "ages,"
and it is thought by many, that it is more likely Foxhounds
were derived from it, than that it was the other
way about. The same colours are found amongst
Harriers as with his larger and more numerous comrades,
but usually, for some reason, not disclosed, more
of the "pied," (particularly the hare-pied, yellow and
white, shaded with black or grey on the back or saddle)
and the sort of dapple, or freckle, generally termed
"blue mottle," is thought to be peculiar to Harrier
blood, and that, when it makes its appearance amongst
any <i>other</i> of the hounds, it shows a cross of "Harrier
blood," somewhere in the strain! This colour is often
accompanied with hound-tan markings on head, and
black patches on body, although the latter do not con<span class="pagenum hide"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span><span class="pagenum hide"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>duce to the beauty of the specimen. Some of the packs
of Welsh Harriers, which for scenting and working
qualities, are very hard to beat, are so versatile, that it
is said they will "hunt anything with a hairy skin,"
unless they are broken from it when young, and I have
heard of a pack, in the Principality, which regularly
hunts hares, until Fox hunting begins, when the
"Green Coats" are exchanged for "Pink," and they
take up the pursuit of Reynard, as to the manner born!
The height of the Harrier is a matter of taste. "Stonehenge"
puts it at under twenty inches; probably the
average is about eighteen inches. A well-known
sportsman in Dorsetshire, in 1871, speaks of the pack
belonging to the late Mr. T. B. Evans, of Chettle,
near Blandford, which he considered <i>the best he had
ever seen</i>, and consisted of bitches fifteen and a half
inches, combining the blood of the packs of Messrs.
Wicksted, Hurrell, Boughley, and Sir Vincent Corbet.
He goes on to say, "The education of this pack is marvellous;
rabbits are frequently left to feed in the kennel,
and occasionally, I am told, coupled to any reprobates
of the pack, to shame them from molesting them!
I have hunted with these hounds, and have had the
very great pleasure of seeing them handled by that
supreme master of his art. I have seen these hounds
pass by rabbits, as Pointers would go through a poultry
yard. I have watched them as they spread, like a fan,
when they were picking out a cold scent, the worthy
master sitting quietly on his cob, and when they recovered
it, seen them stream away, with voices "like a Peal
of Bells," and as close together as a flock of pigeons!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
I have observed how they followed all the hare's doublings,
and with the true Harrier instinct, cast back,
when in perplexity, never "babbling," skirting, or
puzzling over other stains, but, carrying on the line,
until they pulled down their game, sometimes even,
after a forty-five minutes burst. Many sportsmen
complain in the present day that Harriers are becoming
too fast to do their work properly, and that, this has
arisen from crosses with Foxhounds, the original variety,
being thought to date back to the old "Southern
Hound," more remarkable for their great powers of
scent, and hunting quality, than for pace.</p>

<p><i>Beagles.</i>&mdash;This is another breed which is yearly gaining
in popularity and is really a miniature hound, of
which there are two varieties, rough and smooth, differing
only in texture of coat, and these are subdivided
again into different heights, ranging from under sixteen
and over twelve inches to under twelve and over ten
inches, which latter are often called "Pocket Beagles."
The skull should be fairly long and wide, slightly domed,
with well defined "stop;" short and tapering muzzle;
open nostrils and largish nose; thin long ears hanging
folded; soft large eyes. No dewlap, but muscular neck,
rather long, deep chest, for size; muscular thighs; well
boned and straight forelegs; round, cat-like feet; stern
carried gaily. Regular colours of Foxhounds, whom
they resemble in many ways, coat flat, dense, and close.
These are quite picturesque little creatures, and I have
known them kept as pets and companions, but, of
course, they are supposed to be used for their work as<span class="pagenum hide"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span><span class="pagenum hide"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>

brethren. Frequently they call forth a considerable following
in the parts they travel over, and many cricketers

desire to keep "in condition" during the "off season,"
habitually attend the nearest meets of Beagles

<p><span class="smcap">I have</span> adopted the above title, instead of the more
usual term of "Sporting Dogs," so as to be able to include
breeds about which there is a difference of opinion
as to whether they are strictly "Sporting Dogs"
or not, and propose in this chapter to say a few words
about Bloodhounds, Otter Hounds and Great Danes,
taking them in that order. Many of my readers, as
well as I, can remember the time, within the last thirty
years, when <i>Bloodhounds</i> were few and far between,
and the entries of this handsome and aristocratic-looking
breed were at a low ebb, even at the best
shows. This is no longer the case, thanks to the
enterprise and zeal of a few well-known breeders,
of whom stands in the very front rank, my friend
Mr. Edwin Brough, of Scarborough, who gained
some of his knowledge and experience at the
feet of my old friend, Mr. Edwin Nichols, of West
Kensington, who, as a breeder as well as exhibitor of
Bloodhounds, Mastiffs and Newfoundlands, was the
most successful I have ever known and, in my opinion,
quite unsurpassed as a judge of those breeds and
one of the most entertaining companions I have ever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
met. Seldom when I came across him at any Dog
Show, which was very often in the days I was an extensive
exhibitor, but that he kept up the company to
a late hour with his entertaining stories of men and
dogs! I much regret that, owing to advancing years,
he has discontinued his attendance at the gatherings, at
which he had such troops of friends and where he, under
the title of "Papa-Nichols," was so universally
popular. It is a tradition that the Bloodhound is identical
with the Sleuth, or Slouth, Hound (from the
word "Slouth" probably meaning "scent,") and that
he is of a very ancient breed in these Islands, used for
tracking "Moss Troopers" and other wrong doers in
the olden days; the earliest record of them occurs in
King Henry III.'s time, when they were used in tracking
offenders. The most usual colours are shades of
rich tan with more or less dark markings on body and
head, which latter is long, lean and "peaked," the face
thin and narrow, the skin loose and puckered; long
folded and pendulous ears; broad nose, expanded nostrils;
long thin, flabby and pendulous flews; deep and
voluminous dewlap; sunken, bloodshot eyes, and flexible,
active stern, thick at root, tapering to a point.
The Hound strikes you as not over large, but with
great character, quality and much dignity, well knit;
plenty of bone; symmetrical, straight legs; wide across
the back, full in body, and back ribs; and game in temperament;
with fine, deep sloping shoulders, and enormously
powerful hind quarters. The points associated
with the Bloodhound, are as follows:&mdash;Skull, long, narrow
and very much peaked, square, deep muzzle; ears,<span class="pagenum hide"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span><span class="pagenum hide"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>thin, long, set on rather low, hanging in shapely folds
close against the face; eyes, deep set, dark colour and
lustrous, lids, triangular shaped, showing the red haw;
flews, long, thin, and pendulous, the upper overhanging
the lower lips; neck, rather long and slightly arched
towards base of skull, plenty of dewlaps; wrinkled
skin of face, very loose and abundant; short, close
lying coat, thin skin; sloping and deep shoulders,
broad, muscular loins, well let down brisket, powerful
thighs and second thighs; strong, straight legs; feet
round, with well bent hocks, stern tapering and carried
gaily. Colours: black and tan, tawny and red and
tan. General appearance that of a high class, aristocratic
and very dignified animal, who looks as if he
considered himself fit company for an emperor, and
would not care to associate with any but those belonging
to the "upper circles."</p>

<p><i>Otter Hounds.</i>&mdash;I should like just to say a few words
about this picturesque breed, made familiar to us by the
paintings of Landseer, Ansdell, Noble, and Frederick
Tayler, and of which I had some beautiful specimens
before me at the National Dog Show at Birmingham,
in November 1898. The colours are, usually, dark and
light browns and tans, mixed with grizzle, the general
appearance somewhat like rough-coated Bloodhounds,
with just a dash of an overgrown Dandie about them;
very rugged and unsophisticated they look, but <i>quite
charming</i> to an artistic eye, and convey the idea that,
when they know what they are wanted to do, they will
not hesitate to do it, whatever it may be. Any animals<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
that have to contend with such a wily, active, and resourceful
foe as the Otter, either on land, or where he
is still more "at home," <i>in water</i>, have to be pretty
"spry" if they would give a good account of him. Of
course, these hounds are usually kept in packs, and
do not, as a rule, enjoy much human company, except
connected with their training for their work, and the
exercise of it, but would be an ornament to <i>any</i> establishment,
and, if I mistake not, were prime favourites
of his Royal Highness, the lamented Prince Consort,
whose ability as a sportsman, and taste as a connoisseur
of all relating to art and things beautiful, are well
known to his many admirers. I remember seeing the
engraving of a beautiful picture, I presume in the possession
of H. M. the Queen, either by Richard Ansdell,
R. A., or the late Frederick Tayler, R. W. S., showing
his Royal Highness in a rough, wide bottomed boat,
crossing a Highland loch, with a pack of these beautiful
hounds, some in the boat, some on the bank, and some
in the water, either just starting for, or just returning
from, an Otter hunt, and it impressed me very much. I
may say, that it is very usual to have some Dandies,
Skyes, or other Scottish terriers, associated with a pack
of Otter Hounds, to assist in dislodging the quarry,
when it takes refuge amongst the boulders and rocks, so
often met in the haunts of the graceful Otter.
The packs of these dogs are chiefly in Dumfrieshire,
Cumberland, Devon, and some parts of Wales, both
North and South.</p>

<p>I have come across such a detailed account of the
Otter, and rules for hunting it, in a book <i>more than</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
<i>three hundred years old</i>, but which show the writer
to be well informed on the subject, and a man of such
keen observation, that I venture to quote it in the
quaint, original language, hoping it may be interesting
to some of the "sportsmen" amongst my readers:&mdash;"The
Otter is a beast well-knowne&mdash;she feedeth on
fishe, and lyeth neareunto Ryvers, Brookes, Pooles, and
Fishpondes, or Weares. Hir lying in, commonly, is
under the roots of trees, and, sometymes, I have seene
them lying in a hollowe Tree, foure, or five, foote,
above the grounde. Even as a Foxe, Polcat, Wylde
Cat, or Badgerd, will destroye a Warren, so wyll the
Otter destroye all the Fishe in your Pondes, if she once
have founde the waye to them. She dyveth, and hunteth,
under the water, after a wonderfull mannere, so
that, no Fishe can escape hir, unlesse they be verie
great, and swyfte. A lytter of Otteres, will destroye
you, all the Fishe, in a Ryver, in two myles lengthe.
There is great cunninge, in the Hunting of them, as
shalle be saide in the next Chaptere; and also, it is
possible, to take them, under the Water, and by the
Ryver's syde, both in trappes, and in snares, as you
may take a Hare, with hare-pypes, or such lyke
gynnes. Theye byte sore, and venomouslye, and defende
themselves stoutlye. I wyll not speake much
more of their nature, but, onely, that they are footed
lyke a Goose. I meane, they have a webbe betweene
theyr clawes, and have no heeles, but, onely, a rounde
balle, under theyr soale, of theyr foote, and theyr tracke
is called the 'Marke' of an Otter, as we saye the
'Slot' of an Harte. An Otter, abydeth not muche,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
nor longe, in one place, but, if she be befrayde, or finde
any faulte (as they are verie perfectlye of smellinge,
and hearinge,) they wyll forsake theyr couche, and
shifte a myle, or two, up, or doune, a Ryver. The lyke,
wyll she do, if she have once destroyed the store of
Fishe, and finde no plentie of feedinge. From a Ponde-Garden,
or goode store of Fish-Pondes, she wyl not,
lytely, be removed, as long as there is store of fishe in
them; for therein, fishes are takene, with more ease,
than in the Ryveres, or greatere wateres, but, inough
of theyr natures. When, a Huntsman, woulde hunt
the Otter, he shoulde, first, sende foure Servantes, or
Varlets, with Bloodehoundes, or suche Houndes as wyl
drawe in the game, and lette hym sende them, two up
the Ryver, and two doune the Ryver, the one couple of
them, on that one syde, and the other on that other syde
of the water. And so, you shalle be sure to finde, if
there be an Otter in the quarter, for, an Otter, cannot
longe abide in the water, but muste come forthe, in the
nyghte, to feede on grasse, and herbes, by the waters
syde. If, any of theyr Houndes, finde of an Otter, lette
the Huntsman looke, in the softe groundes, and moyst
places, to see, which way he bente the heade, up, or
doune, the Ryver. And, if he finde not the Otter,
quicklye, he may then judge, that he is gonne to couche,
somewhere, further offe from the water; for an Otter,
wyl, sometymes, seeke hys feede, a myle, or lyttle lesse,
from hys couche, and place of reste. Commonlye, he
will rather go up the Ryver, than doune, for, goyng up
the Streame, the Streame bryngeth him sente of the
Fishes, that are above hym, and bearynge hys nose into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
the wynde, he shall the soonere finde any faulte, that is
above hym. Also, you shoulde make an Assemblye,
for the Otter, as you do for the Harte, and it is a note,
to be observed, that all such chaces, as you drawe after,
before you finde them, lodge them, or harbor them, you
shoulde make a solemne Assemblye, to heare all reportes,
before you undertake to hunte them, and then,
he whyche have founde of an Otter, or so drawen
towardes hys couche, that he can undertake to brynge
you unto hym, shall cause hys Houndes to be uncouplede,
a bowshotte, or twyane, before he come to the
place, where, he thynketh, that the Otter lyeth. Because,
they may caste aboute a whyle, until they have
cooled theyr baulinge and hainsicke-toyes, which all
Houndes do, lykely, use at the fyrst uncouplinge.
Then, the Varlets of the Kennell, shall seeke, by the
Ryversyde, and beate the bankes, with theyr Houndes,
untill some of them chance upon the Otter. Remember,
alwayes, to set out, some upwardes, and some
doune, the Streames, and everye man hys Otter Speare,
or forked staffe, in hys hande, and, if they misse, them,
shall they runne up, or doune, the Streame, as they see
the Otter bende, until they may, at laste, give hym a
blowe. For, if the Houndes, be good Otter-Houndes,
and perfectlye enterede, they wyl come chauntinge, and
traylinge, alongst by the Ryversyde, and will beate,
every tree-roote, every holme, every osier-bedde, and
tufte of bullrushes; yea, sometymes, also, they wyl
take the Ryver, and beate it, lyke a Water-Spaniell, so
that, it shalle not be possible for the Otter to escape,
but that eyther, the Houndes shall lyte upon hym, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
els, some of the Hunts men shalle stryke hym, and,
thusse, you maye have excellente sporte, and pastyme,
in hunting of the Otter, if the Houndes be goode and
that the Ryveres be not over greate. Where the Ryveres
be greate, some use to have a lyne, thrwen overthwart
the Ryvere, the whyche, two of the Huntsmen
shalle holde, by eche ende, one on the one syde of
the Ryvere, and the othere, on that othere. And, lette
them holde the lyne so slacke, that it may, alwayes, be
underneathe the watere. And, if the Otter come dyvynge,
under the watere, he shalle, of necesstie, touche
theyr lyne, and so, they shall feele, and knowe, whyche
waye he is passed, the whyche shalle make hym be
taken the soonere. An Otter's Skynne, is very good
furre, and his grease, wyll make a medycyne, to make
fishes turn uppe theyr bellies, as if they weare deade. A
goode Otter Hounde may prove an excellente good
Bucke Hounde, if he be not olde, before he be enterred."
Another writer, of about twenty-five years
since, in speaking of the Otterhound, says: "He is
bred to stand wet or rheumatism, to hunt by eye, as well
as scent, to mark the 'bubbles' when his quarry is
'down,' and join in the chase, in the Otter's element.
Failing that, he has to stoop to the scent again. He
must be undistracted by whoops and halloos of the attending
multitude, observing the huntsman only, and
answering his horn and cheer. With many a blank
day and disappointment, he must resolutely hunt and
face a '<i>water demon</i>.' The points of the breed are
laid down as follows:&mdash;The head should, in shape, be
something between that of the Bloodhound and Fox-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span><span class="pagenum hide">
<a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span><span class="pagenum hide"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>hound. It should show much of the gravity, and dignity
of the former, but rather flatter and harder in
character; forehead long and narrow; eyes rather sunken,
shewing the 'haw,' but large and dark in colour;
nostrils large and roomy, nose itself, black, and a good
size, with rough-haired muzzle and full, hanging lips;
ears coated with coarse hair, without feathering at
edges, but very large, thin, and pendulous; neck fairly
throaty, muscular, and of a good length; chest more
deep than wide; rather loose back ribs, but strong,
deep, long and straight; feet large, not close, and well
webbed between toes; muscular thighs; powerful sloping
shoulders, with elbows well let down; tail carried
in a sloping position, fairly coated with hair, decreasing
towards the end; coat not short, but dense, hard and
wiry, very weather resisting in character; colours may
be black, dull white and creamy tan, or black and tan,
black and white, grizzled pied, buff, or shades of brown,
or brownish tan."</p>

<p><i>Great Danes.</i>&mdash;I suppose, at the present time, it will
be generally admitted that the largest, and best, kennel
of this breed is in the hands of one of the handsomest,
and most graceful, of the many enthusiastic ladies interested
in the kennel-world, and that one of the most
charming sights at many of our largest shows is to
see a team of these beautiful dogs, accompanied by
their fair owner, and from the crowds of the public I
have noticed outside the rings, on such occasions, I
have no doubt they were appreciative spectators. The
points of the breed, as stated by a well known breeder<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
and exhibitor, are:&mdash;The head, which should be carried
high, rather long, and not too broad; muzzle broad,
strong, and blunt; eyes small, with sharp expression;
neck long and arched, free from any dewlaps; chest
moderately broad; brisket deep, loin slightly arched;
shoulders sloping, elbows well under; belly well tucked
up; legs straight, and muscular, second thighs, long
and strong; feet rather large, well arched and close;
ears dropped at the tips and carried as in Black and Tan
Terriers, small as possible in proportion to size of
animal; coat hard, short, and dense; tail strong at base
ending in fine tapering point, carried rather low, not
much below curve of hindquarters. General appearance,
that of an upstanding, determined animal, with
whom it would be best to avoid a difference of opinion
if possible, but one who would, doubtless, be all right,
when you knew him, and he knew you!<span class="pagenum hide"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span></p>

<p><i>The Pointer.</i>&mdash;Although this variety of dog has not,
in the general way, enjoyed the advantage of constant
human society, to anything like the extent possessed by
some others, there is little doubt numbers of the family
have developed considerable intelligence, particularly
in connection with their work. The late Mr. Forster
of Manchester, relates that a Pointer belonging to him,
when out with his master, would, if he missed a bird,
go up to him, seize hold of and shake his gaiter, as if
to remonstrate with him for not making better use of
the game he had found for him. And the late Revd.
T. Pearce, no mean authority on most breeds of
"sporting dogs," said in speaking of Pointers, "I have
no prejudice for the Setter, over the Pointer, although
I have had ten Setters to one Pointer. If the ground I
shoot over suits the Pointer, the Pointer suits me, but I
do not think he is quite so well adapted for the gun as
the Setter, provided the Setter is of equal talent and
adequately broken. But, it would be hard to find anything
more perfect than some Pointers I have shot over
myself, or more thoroughly intelligent, industrious and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
sensible. One of them, 'old Jesse' a chance dog I
had of Mr. Meir, for Snipe shooting, was a fine example
indeed. As his pedigree was not ascertained, he
was not used for breeding purposes, but was a fine
specimen of some Yorkshire strain, large size, and
liver and white in colour. If I missed him in driving
off to my Snipe grounds, he would track my pony and
gig like a sleuth hound, and many a time have I found
him close behind my wheels, when I have, for miles,
looked back for him in vain. One bright winter morning
I sat on a gate waiting for one Capt. Hull, my companion,
and looking up a long stretch of road, I observed
'old Jesse' coming along with a young dog of
mine which he had evidently invited to join in the fun,
and so I let the young dog work on Snipe, a game he
was never on before. It was a sight to see how 'old
Jesse' tried to teach him the trade. I had two pieces
of Snipe bog two miles apart, and one bad scenting
day he missed my track and went to the wrong place,
so that it was past one o'clock when I reached the place
to which he had gone. On getting there, which I generally
shot first, I saw 'old Jesse' standing stiffly on a
Snipe. How long he had been 'pointing' I cannot
say. Frequently, as I walked up to his point, I have
flushed Snipe, and shot them, before I reached him, but
this made no difference to him, nor did it in the least
interfere with his steadiness. Once, on the occasion I
have mentioned of his being accompanied by the young
dog, he snarled at the youngster for flushing a Jack
Snipe, and when he repeated the fault, went up and
worried him severely. As two of us shot together, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
got into the habit of coming to my room in the morning,
to see if I was dressed for shooting, and if I was not,
he would go to my companion's chamber and accompany
him, or track him through the streets, if he had
gone on, and I do not remember that he ever failed to
find him. 'Julie,' a liver and white Pointer bitch, was
another of my Pointers which showed great sagacity
and firmness. We have frequently lost her, for a considerable
time, in a high cover on a celebrated piece of
ground called Keysworth, in Dorsetshire, belonging to
my friend, Mr. Drax, and at last we have seen the
'sting' of her fine stern above the rushes, for she
always held it higher than her head. She was one of
the most intelligent dogs I ever possessed, and would
retrieve any game alive. Though only in her second
season, she was the animal always sent out with young
hands, and if they ran to pick up their game, she would
bark at them reproachfully. I never had a Pointer
before, that seemed to enter so keenly into the sport,
or to appreciate, as she did, the real and proper style of
beating for game."</p>

<p>The points of this well known sportsman (Pointer)
are:&mdash;Skull rather wide between the ears, with a pronounced
drop at the "stop," the occipital protuberance
being also well defined, the muzzle being long and bent
at the nose, which is rather dark liver, or else flesh
coloured, eyes dark or light according to colours of
markings, ears rather fine, set on low and hanging flat
to the sides of the head; neck gracefully arched and
quite free from overlaps, shoulders sloping, chest moderately
wide, and extremely deep, body powerful and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
well ribbed up at the loin, forelegs dead straight, set
well in under the dog, heavy in bone, the feet being
round and compact, hind quarters powerful, the stifle
being a little turned out and the hocks well let down,
tail rather short and tapering to the tip, coat moderately
fine. Colours: liver and white, lemon and
white, black, or black and liver ticked.</p>

<p><i>The English Setter.</i>&mdash;The elegant family known by
the above title, are divided into three branches, called
respectively English, Gordon and Irish; each have their
body of supporters, and many very beautiful specimens
of them all are to be seen at our best shows. Perhaps
Birmingham lays itself out most for the sporting dog
classes, but now, when there are so many large exhibitions
held in various parts of the United Kingdom, the
same dogs are more often seen at the various places.
The following descriptions of each of the three branches
of the family, are taken from notes communicated by a
well known gentleman in the doggy world, to a work on
dogs published some seventy-five years since. "The
head of the English Setter should not be so heavy as
the Pointer's, nor so wide across the ears. There
should be at least four inches from the inner corner of
the eye to the point of the nose. In many first class
dogs, there is half an inch more. The nasal bone
should be rather depressed in the centre and slightly
raised at the nostrils. The nose and nostrils large,<span class="pagenum hide"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span><span class="pagenum hide"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>the nose dark liver coloured or black, moist and
shining. The jaws should be level and the teeth exactly
level in front, as nothing detracts more from appearance
than the 'snipe nose.' There should not be
that fullness of lip, allowable in the Pointer, but, at
the angles of the mouth, the lips should be rather pendulous.
The ears, which are usually about six inches in
length, should be set low on the head, larger where they
are attached, than at the tips, which should be round,
not pointed. They should never be pricked, or carried
forward, even when the dog points. The eyes should
be large and sparkling, not protruding, as in the King
Charles Spaniel, but well set and full of intelligence.
The neck, long, thin, slightly arched at crest, and clean
cut where it joins the head, this last a most important
point. The shoulders should be well set back, the
blades long, the muscles well-developed throughout.
Ribs not so widely sprung as the Pointer's. The back
ribs deep and fairly near to the hip bone. The chest
deep and moderately wide. The loins broad and
arched slightly and the hips wide. The hind quarters
square, strongly made and the stifles well bent. Cat-like
feet are preferable to the 'hare' or 'spoon' foot.
The round foot, with toes well arched, distributes the
power of the toes more evenly, and is best suited for
every description of shooting ground, in fact, the Foxhound
foot, and leg with it. The feet should be
straight, neither turned in or out. The toes should be
well furnished with hair, which, in the best breeds,
forms a tuft between the toes and protects the sole,
being replenished as fast as it wears away. The pas<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>terns should be nearly upright and large, knees large,
forelegs upright, and in a standing position, the legs
should be like good forelegs in a Horse, the feet slightly
in advance of straight, the hocks strong, set a little in,
if any deviation from a straight line. The stern of a
Setter, like that of a Spaniel, should be carried as much
as possible in a line with the backbone. The undulating
sweep upwards, if exaggerated, would become a
serious fault. A Setter's stern cannot well be too
straight, and it should never be too long or it cannot be
carried handsomely. The stern looks better when the
'feather' commences near the root of the tail and goes
off gradually to nothing at the tip. A tail blunt, or
clubbed, is very objectionable. The coat should be of
the finest silky texture, moderately waved, but devoid of
curl. There may be an inclination in the coat to part
down the back. Colours in order of merit: 1. Blue
mottle, or Belton greys, which stand work and are
better than; 2. Orange and white and lemon and
white; 3. black and white; 4. pure white; 5. pure
black; 6. fawn or yellow; 7. liver colour or liver
and white, which last too often indicates a cross with
the Pointer or Water Spaniel.</p>

<span class="caption">GORDON-SETTER. CH. &quot;MARQUIS&quot;. T. JACOBS. OWNER.</span>
</div>

<p>"<i>The Gordon Setter.</i>&mdash;The points of excellence in
the Gordon, closely resemble those of the English
Setter, but, I may observe, that the great features
of true Gordon blood are, that they can go much longer
without water than the generality of Setters, and that
they show more variety in their attitude on 'the point.'
The length of their shoulders, their large bone, and<span class="pagenum hide"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span><span class="pagenum hide"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>their development of muscle, enable them to race, and
to keep it up. The colour of the Gordon is a great
point. The black should be <i>raven</i> black, with a blue, or
plum bloom, on the bright lights. The tan a rich red,
of burnt sienna, colour. It should be, by no means, yellow
or tabby, or mixed with black or fawn, but rich,
deep, a sort of bright new mahogany. The cheeks,
lips, throat, feet, back of the forelegs to the elbow, front
of the hind legs up to the hips, belly, inside of thighs,
vent, underside of flag, inside of ears, should all be
brilliant red, and there should be a large brilliant spot
of tan over each eye. There is no objection to a white
short frill, although the absence of all white is a good
thing. White toes behind, are less objectionable
than white toes in front, and several of the very
best Gordons have even had a white foot, or feet, but
this is not to be desired if it can be avoided. The
origin of the breed is not well known. The late Duke
of Gordon, at any rate, brought it up to its present excellence.
There is a suspicion it came originally from
Ireland, and the fact that nearly all the best Gordon
bitches have had in every litter, one or more deep red,
or orange, whelps, leads one to believe there has been an
Irish cross. The Gordon Setter's stern is shorter than
that of the English Setter, but 'sting like.' Failing
this, breeders find they have that greatest trouble to
the Gordon breeder, the 'teapot tail,' or a long stern
with a curl at the end, badly carried in action. He is a
long, low, Setter, his gallop noiseless, and he is remarkably
quick in his turn, from the power of his
shoulders and loins, length of his neck and general<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
muscular development, a trifle heavier in his head,
shorter in his stern, rather deeper in his 'brisket,' more
bony and muscular than the English Setter, with a remarkably
gay temperament. 'Always busy,' he is quite
the beau ideal of a sportsman's favourite, but he has his
failings. He is more frequently 'gunshy,' more often
the victim of distemper, than the English, and, occasionally,
so headstrong as to be totally irreclaimable,
these may be the faults of education, and generally are
so, but undeniably they are more often the results of
inbreeding or injudicious crossing.</p>

</div>

<p>"<i>The Irish Setter.</i>&mdash;The head of the Irish Setter
should be long, narrow, yet wide in the forehead,
arched or peaked cranium behind. A short, bullet
head, a wide flat one, or one running to a point at the
snout, are very common, and very bad. The lips should
be deep or moderately so. The ears should be long,
reaching at the end of the hair, to the nose, pendulous
and as if lying in a fold, set well back and low on the
head; they should never be set high, short in length,
or half diamond shaped, their feather should be moderate.
The eyes of rich hazel or rich brown, well set,
full, kind, sensible and loving, the iris mahogany
colour, should never be gooseberry, black, or prominent
and staring. The nose mahogany, dark flesh, or blackish
mahogany, never black or pink. Even dark flesh is
not so much admired, though it may be with a good
clear hazel eye. The whiskers should be red. The
forelegs straight, moderately feathered, the feet close
and small, not round like a hounds, or splayed. The<span class="pagenum hide"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span><span class="pagenum hide"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>hams straight, flat and muscular, and feathered well
with buff coloured hair, the hind quarters, altogether
square and active in make. The chest should be wide
when the dog is sitting on his haunches, and the head
held back and full; too wide a chest is apt to give a
waddling and slow gait. The chest ribs cannot be too
deep. The loins, for speed, should be long, moderately
wide, and the belly well tucked up. The tail should
be well covered with coarse hair, curling along the tops,
and hanging moderately, though bushy, from beneath;
carried on a horizontal line with the back, not cocked
or curled. In the field, or excitement, carried low, stiff
and beating the hind legs. The coat should be rather
coarse, smooth or wavy, not curly, hair of moderate
length, on the upper parts of the body, the root half
tawny, the tip half deep sienna, a sort of blood red, but
never showing black on the ears, back, head, or tail.
The legs and under parts deep or pale tawny. White
should not appear anywhere except in the centre of the
forehead and the centre of the breast."</p>

<p>It maybe interesting to some of my readers (amongst
whom I hope will be included fanciers of every breed,
as well as some who have been hitherto fanciers of no
breed at all), if I set out here the show points of Setters,
taking them in their usual order, as "English," "Gordon,"
and "Irish."</p>


<p><i>The English Setter.</i>&mdash;The head should be long and
rather narrow, the skull slightly domed and not very
broad at base, muzzle long, square and clean, not too
pointed at end; nose moderately large, with wide nos<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>trils, ears fine, set on low and lying close to sides of
head; eyes, soft, bright and intelligent, not light in
colour. Neck very muscular and of fair length; shoulders
clean and sloping, chest not wide but deep;
back strong and muscular; ribs well sprung and
deep; powerful, broad loin; thighs fairly long and
muscular; stifles well let down and bent; forelegs well
feathered and straight, pasterns short, straight and
firm; stern medium length, well set on, almost in line
with back, not carried gaily or curled; feet close and
compact, slightly feathered between toes. Coat free
from any curl, soft, wavy and silky. Colours: blue
and white ticked, white with black markings and white
with liver markings most favoured, but almost any
others allowed except red, and black and tan.</p>


<p><i>The Gordon or Black and Tan Setters</i> are supposed
to have been so called from their original connection
with Gordon Castle Kennels. There are, however, said
to be many good specimens not in any way related to
that particular strain, the colour of which was tricolour,
black, tan and white. This variety is heavier
than their English or Irish brethren, and shows more
of the Hound and less of the Spaniel. The head is
stronger, with deeper and broader muzzle and heavier
lips, the ears are also somewhat longer, and the eyes
often show the haw; the black should be as jet and
absolutely free from white. The tan on cheeks and
over eyes and on feet and pasterns should be rich and
bright and clearly defined, and the feathering on forelegs
and thighs should also be tan.<span class="pagenum hide"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span><span class="pagenum hide"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span></p>

<p><i>The Irish Setters</i> are higher on the leg than their English
cousins, although, in most respects, the conformation
of body is precisely the same in both breeds. Head
long and narrow, muzzle square, lips moderately deep,
ears fine, set low and lying well back, giving a domed
appearance to the skull; "stop" well defined, eyes rich
hazel or dark brown, soft and expressive. Chest deep
and ribs well sprung; shoulders clean and sloping; loin
somewhat arched, broad and muscular. <i>Coat</i>, lustrous
and rather plentiful, rich, dark red, with a golden tinge,
no white allowable, except a star on head or chest.</p>

<p><i>The Retriever.</i>&mdash;This breed is practically divided
into two varieties, one called The Flat, Smooth, or
Wavy-coated, and the other the Curly; both, as a
rule, are black, but as far as my experience of them
goes, more specimens "other than black" are seen
amongst "the Curlies" than the others, but I think,
undoubtedly, blacks, of either variety, are the handsomest.
Both breeds have been brought to a great
point of perfection. <i>In the Flat-coated</i>, Mr. S. E.
Shirley and Colonel Cornwall-Legh, and <i>in the Curly-coated</i>,
Earl Melville and Mr. S. Darbey, can show
teams to make a sportsman "tear his hair;" often and
often, one of these varieties has taken the coveted prize
for the "best sporting dog in the show," and they are
remarkable amongst the many charming breeds of sporting
dogs bred and established in this country, for their
very "matching character," so that, a high bred lot of
either variety have a wonderful family likeness, and on
the many occasions when I have had to take part in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
making the awards for the sporting and non-sporting
teams, it has been a great pleasure to me to see
grouped together, in different parts of an immense
ring, teams of the various breeds, often containing
the best known specimens of them, quite priceless, and
which no money could buy, but most interesting to the
lovers of beautiful, and in many cases, perfect specimens
of animals.</p>


<p><i>Show Points of Wavy, Flat, or Smooth Retrievers.</i>&mdash;<i>Head</i>
long and skull fairly wide; ears small and lying
close to head; eyes brown or hazel and showing great
intelligence; jaws long, and sufficiently strong to carry
a Hare; muzzle fairly large, with full open nostrils;
teeth level and sound; neck fairly long; chest deep and
somewhat narrow; shoulders clean and strong, set
obliquely; ribs deep, and well sprung; body long, with
muscular loins; forelegs straight and strong; quarters
muscular; stifles fairly bent; feet sound, and well
arched; coat long, and straight, and of good quality;
black, without any trace of white, is the fashionable
colour, but classes for "other than black," are sometimes
well filled. White and liver coloured specimens
are sometimes met with, but seldom shown. <i>General
appearance</i> is that of a strong, upstanding, intelligent
dog, of a decidedly sporting character, but quite prepared
to take on any class of work required of him as
a "general utility dog."</p>

<p><i>The Curly-coated Retriever.</i>&mdash;There has been much
discussion as to the origin of this variety, which, like<span class="pagenum hide"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span><span class="pagenum hide"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>that of its "Flatcoated" comrade, does not go back,
it is thought, before the commencement of this century.
Some think the old "water dog" we see depicted
in the sporting pictures of our ancestors (and
which looked like a cross of indifferent Poodle, with an
inferior old English sheep dog, without much of the
good points of either variety!), others claim the Irish
Water Spaniel, and others again, the Poodle, to have
been one of its parents in a cross with the Labrador
dog, in the same way as its flat-coated cousin is supposed
to have been produced by a cross between a Setter
and a Labrador dog. I do not propose to enter
into this controversy at all, personally I have had
more to do with the Irish Water Spaniels (of which my
brothers and I have had a great many amongst us since
we were lads), and Poodles, of which I have had a good
many and handled and judged hundreds, and I think I
can see traces of the Irish Water Spaniel <i>and</i> the Poodle
in the modern Curly-coated Retriever, but more of
the former than the latter. I think, undoubtedly, the
Curlies are the hardest to breed approaching perfection,
but they are wonderfully "fetching," when up to the
mark. The absence of curl, too much hair on face, and
the openness of coat, are the faults I most often notice,
and some fail in the tail not being as it should be, covered
from root to end with small, tight curls, as on
body. The sort of curls on the body may be described
as like those on a nigger's head.</p>


<p><i>The Points for Show of the Curly Retriever</i> are not
much at variance with those for the Flat-coated. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
the latter is often the larger dog. The head, should
be not so wide, with strong jaws, and muzzle more inclined
to be snipey; the coat, a perfect mass of short,
tight curls on the body, legs and tail, but only short,
smooth hair on the face&mdash;the stern, quite straight and
carried without any curve in it, substantial at root, lessening
in size by degrees to its point.<span class="pagenum hide"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">sporting spaniels&mdash;basset hounds&mdash;dachshounds</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">A good</span> many I have known, make much and think
highly of some of the breeds of Spaniels. These are
noted for their affectionate disposition and docility.
The least often seen, and therefore not much known,
are the <i>Irish and the English Water Spaniels</i>. The
former should be dark liver coloured, covered with
curls, except on the tail, which should be nearly bare
of hair, and on the head a considerable tuft of hair,
called the top-knot, hanging down over the eyes and
face, so as to almost hide the former. There is something
very comical, and quite "Hibernian," about the
look of this breed, and they always appear to be open
for any amount of fun, but they are also grand workers,
and for duck-shooting, and retrieving in general,
they are above the average in achievements, as they are
above most of their fellows in size. <i>The English
Variety</i> is also a capital all-round useful dog, generally
roan or dark coloured in ground, with sometimes spots
or markings on head and body, also covered with curls,
and looks best with tail moderately docked. He gives
you the idea of a "business dog," and is very lively and
ready for work of almost any sporting kind, and can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
stand a deal of it. Another of the family I am very
partial to and have sometimes met with and kept as a
companion, is the Clumber. I think this is the most
aristocratic-looking of the sporting varieties of the
breed, and should be a creamy white, with patches of
lemon or light orange-tan, about the head and body.
Either the tactics of the sportsmen of the present day
are too rapid, or for some other cause, but there certainly
are not so many of the breed to be seen now as
there were some fifteen or twenty years since, but I am
glad to see the present Duke of Newcastle is keeping
up the breed at Clumber, where it is supposed to have
been originally produced, and that there are still a few
kennels in the country, where they are breeding some
of these beautiful dogs, for I contend that a Clumber,
in good form and well-groomed (when his coat will
have quite a bloom on it), is one of the handsomest
dogs a sportsman can wish to accompany him, and
although his build and formation are not suited for a
high rate of speed, he can get over a good deal of
ground in the course of the day, and render some useful
service to his owner and his friends. In that celebrated
book, "The Master of the Game," preserved
in the British Museum, and attributed to a royal author,
being supposed to be written by a son of King
Edward III. (who died in 1402), the Spaniel is spoken
of as "Saynolfe," no doubt a term intended for "Spaynolfe,"
and is described as one of the hounds used for
hawking, and called a Spaynel, "because the nature
of him cometh from Spain, notwithstanding they are
to be found in other countries," and such hounds, the<span class="pagenum hide"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span><span class="pagenum hide"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>

He insists that a good hound for hawking should
have a large head and body, and that he should be of a
"fair hewe," white or tawne, and not too "jough,"
that is, hairy or rough, but, his tail should be "rough,"
or feathered; he goes on to describe the proper temperament,
as a sportsman of the present age would speak
of a modern Clumber, leaving out one of its greatest
merits, its <i>silence</i>, or muteness, in work, however excited,
so much to be desired. A great deal of sport
may be had over a brace of Clumbers, which are as
much as a sportsman can do with, particularly with a
Retriever to look after the "killed and wounded."</p>


<p>I have also, occasionally, seen a specimen of the Sussex
Spaniel, which are rare dogs for work, made a
house pet of. They should be rich copper colour, and
are very showy and distinguished looking in appearance,
strong and muscular in build, more active than
you would give them credit for, by their looks, and
possessed of much intelligence and affection for their
friends, good guards, and well able to take their own
parts in any row, seldom coming off worst, even with
larger antagonists. They have been brought to great
perfection of late years. I should say there are some
as good as any ever seen, to be met with at the present
day, and especially at the well known Bridford Kennels
in Devon. I think they are rather growing in public
favour, to the reverse being the case; I often see what
I may call "the <i>Field Spaniel</i> proper," the old glossy
black, kept as a companion; the very long backed, and
short-legged type, now in favour, don't strike one as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
being able to stand so much hard work, in the covers,
as the more old fashioned sort, but they are, many of
them, very beautiful dogs, and of high quality, and,
what is also of importance to breeders, they command
very high prices. I heard of an instance, not very long
since, when a buyer was found for five or six specimens
of the Black Field Spaniel, at £1,100, and another gave
£400 for a single dog. I know all the three parties,
that is, the seller and the two buyers, in these transactions,
and believe them to be <i>bonâ fide</i> and true, in substance
and fact, so that Spaniel breeding evidently <i>can</i>
be made to pay. Although I sometimes see some of
the old liver and white, roan, blue and black Spaniels
about, I certainly think they are not so popular as
they were some years since. As a rule they are
tractable, good tempered, "born sportsmen," particularly
fond of a ramble amongst country lanes and
hedgerows, and capital companions for all, attaching
themselves readily to ladies and children, and making
themselves "at home" as members of the household,
though always ready for their own proper work, outside,
when called upon.</p>

<p><i>Sporting Spaniel Points.</i>&mdash;I will here give the show
points of the several Sporting Spaniels, commencing
with the <i>Clumber</i>. The points of this breed are as
follows:&mdash;He should be long, low, and heavy, weight
varies, but averages about forty to forty-five pounds.
Colour, white, of a creamy shade, with orange or lemon
markings; actual liver colour, or the very pale lemon,
once made a point of, are now objected to by some<span class="pagenum hide"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span><span class="pagenum hide"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>breeders of the present day. Height should not be
over eighteen or twenty inches. Legs, both short and
strong, in fact, so much so that, with his deep, well-coated
body, he shows little "daylight" below him,
as he stands or walks. Head, large, long, coloured to
a line under the eyes, and showing a "blaze" up the
face. Eyes, rather small for size of head, sunken, pensive,
and thoughtful. Nose, dark flesh, or liver, coloured.
Ears, large and much feathered, below, where
the fleshy part of the ear ends. Neck, long, strong,
and muscular. Back, straight and long. Chest, wide,
also the shoulders, and substantial, likewise the forearm,
which is very heavy for his size. Hocks, and
hind quarters, large, bony, and very muscular. Loins,
not arched, but straight. Ribs, round and prominent,
back-ribs, in particular, very deep. Stern, set on low,
looks best "docked," as is usually the case, with a little
hair hanging at the fag end. Coat should be not too
full in quantity, but very straight, silky, shining, and
soft, in texture. The appearance and general character
being that of a high class, dignified specimen of
the sporting dog, well able to do all that can be reasonably
required of him, but with no idea of being dictated
to, hurried, or "put out of the way," by any one.</p>

<span class="caption">IRISH WATER SPANIEL. CH. &quot;SHAUN&quot;. COL. THE HON. W. LE POER TRENCH. OWNER.</span>
</div>

<p><i>The Irish Water Spaniel.</i>&mdash;The head of the Irish
Water Spaniel is rather large, forehead prominent, face
perfectly smooth from eyes down, ears from twenty-four
to twenty-six inches long from end to end; head
should be crowned with a well-defined top-knot, not
straggling across, like the common Water Dog, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
coming down in a peak on the forehead. The body
should be covered with small, crisp curls, which often
become draggled in the moulting season; the tail,
should be round and "rat-like," without feather, rather
short than the reverse, and as stiff as a ramrod. Colour,
pure puce-shaded liver, without any white.
Height, about from twenty-two to twenty-two and a
half inches, seldom more when pure bred.</p>


<p><i>English Water Spaniel.</i>&mdash;The following description
of this breed, which is a very great favourite of mine,
and I regret to say seems to be growing more scarce,
year by year, is from the pen of my old friend, Mr. A.
W. Langdale, who was counted an authority on Spaniels
generally:&mdash;"Young breeders and judges should
have before them this fact, that <i>Colour</i> should be a secondary
matter with the English Water Spaniel, and the
latter should never pass over a liver and white dog, in
favour of a whole coloured liver, provided the liver and
white is a well-made specimen of his breed. The
weight, again, should not exceed forty pounds, and his
height nineteen inches, his ears may be fairly long, and
covered all over with curl; also the body, not the
close curl of his Irish brother, but one somewhat looser,
and more straggly; his head is broad and long, with
piercing eyes, his legs are well feathered behind, as well
as in front, and there is no doubt that the feather,
which in a ticked dog, comes out from each and every
liver spot in front of the forelegs, has much to do with
his power of endurance in water. They may be called
'natural retrievers,' as no dog is easier taught."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span></p>

<span class="caption">SUSSEX-SPANIEL CH. &quot;BRIDFORD GIDDIE&quot;. MOSES WOOLLAND, OWNER.</span>
</div>


<p><i>The Sussex Spaniel.</i>&mdash;He should be of a deep golden
liver colour, and should weigh about thirty-four
pounds. His head should be long and heavy, his eye
large, and languishing, his forehead projecting over the
eye, the muzzle square, the lips rather pendulous, his
mouth large, and his underjaw rather recedes from the
upper jaw. His ears should be large and well furnished
with silky hair, they should be small, or narrow,
where they spring from the head, and large, or lobe
shaped, at the base; they should be set low down, and
hang close to the cheeks. The nostrils should be large,
the nose large and liver-coloured. The neck should be
strong and muscular, with the crest a little arched.
The chest, should be wide, the shoulders well thrown
back, the body, long, and round. The legs should be
short and strong, well flewed to the foot, before and
behind. The feet, which are nearly always good in a
Spaniel, should be round, well arched, and abundantly
furnished with feather. The loin should be very
strong, the back ribs very deep and round; the tail,
docked to about nine inches, and well-feathered, should
be set low, and have a downward action. The proper
carriage of the tail marks the Spaniel's purity, as much
as anything. The coat should be waved, not curled,
and as already said, of a golden liver colour.</p>

</div>

<p><i>The Black Spaniel.</i>&mdash;The following description of
the points required in this popular variety, are laid
down by my friend, Mr. T. Jacobs, of Newton Abbot,
who is, as far as I know, about the most successful
breeder and exhibitor of them, during the last twenty-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>five
years, he says:&mdash;"My standard is as follows:
Pleasing temper I always look to first, never breed from
a bad tempered sporting dog, every sportsman knows
what a nuisance they are. A long body, short legs,
with plenty of bone and feather, a perfectly smooth,
satin-like coat, with no inclination to wave, or curl,
moderately long. Ears, covered with long, silky hair,
not ringlets, well set, low down, and hung close to the
cheeks, small, or narrow, where they spring from the
head, and large and lobe shaped, at the base, well furnished
with hair on the inside leather. A long head,
not 'snipey,' or heavy, like the Clumber; dark, pleasing
eye, a yellow eye indicates bad temper, and should
be avoided. Level mouth, not 'pig-jawed,' or under
hung, but I prefer the former fault to the latter, which
prevails, I am sorry to see, in some of our present show
dogs. Breeders should avoid them as stock dogs. A
long neck, slightly arched, well clothed with muscle.
Strong across the loins. Ribs well sprung, and barrel-shaped.
Belly, well clothed with long hair and not
tucked up, like the Greyhound, a common fault. Broad
chest, well clothed with muscle and feather. Feet,
round and cat-like, with a plentiful supply of hair between
the toes. Many have argued with me, that
mating black with liver colour, would throw the black
puppies rusty, or bad black, but, being a pigeon breeder
for many years, and knowing that by mating duns and
blacks, you procure a better black than by breeding two
blacks together, I thought if this held good with Pigeons,
why should it not do with dogs? I therefore
mated my Spaniels, as before described, the result is,<span class="pagenum hide"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span><span class="pagenum hide"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>

than a dozen litters in that way."</p>

<span class="caption">COCKER SPANIEL CH. &quot;TED OBO&quot; J. FARROW OWNER.</span>
</div>

<p><i>Some Other Sporting Spaniels.</i>&mdash;The heads of small
Spaniels should resemble those of small Setters, and
have no tuft on them. The ears should be moderately
long, and lie close to the cheek. Very short ears indicate
a cross. The legs should be strong, well feathered
and short; the feet round; and each toe should
be protected with hair, a plentiful supply of which
on, and between the toes, is important. The chest
should be rather broad. The elbows, not so oblique
as in the Setter. The body, should be long, and
somewhat round, and barrel-like, with less depth of
the fore rib than in the Setter. The tail, should come
out on a line with the backbone. The colours may be
almost anything, black, black and white, liver, liver and
white, lemon, lemon and white, roan, blue, or grey
mottled.</p>

<p><i>Bassets.</i>&mdash;Amongst those breeds which have been
taken up a good deal as pets and companions in comparatively
recent years, have been <i>the Bassets</i>, both
<i>Smooth</i> and <i>Rough-coated</i>. This breed, which has been
in fewer hands than most, also enjoys the advantage
of royal patronage, both their Royal Highnesses the
Prince and Princess of Wales, being successful breeders
and exhibitors of them. They are heavy looking,
usually hound marked, in colour, that is, white with
black and light brown, and hound-tanned markings on
body, which is very long shaped on short, strong legs,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
large, pendulous ears and head, and in expression much
like what we used to see in pictures of the "old English
Hound." They have a high-class and distinguished
look about them, and give you the impression
of character and breeding. They have not been used
extensively for sporting purposes in this country, to my
knowledge.</p>

<span class="caption">DACHSHUND CH. &quot;WISEACRE&quot;. E. S. WOODIWISS, OWNER.</span>
</div>

<p><i>Dachshunds.</i>&mdash;Another of the breeds I have seen
kept as pets, is the <i>Dachshund</i>, or Badger Dog, as the
name implies. I think they are rarely, or ever, used
for Badgers in this country, and for the safety of the
greater part of those I have seen here, I think it is
much better that is so, as any one familiar with the
Badger, or the "old Gentleman in Grey," as he is frequently
called, will know that he is a formidable opponent
to tackle, muscular, active, low to the ground,
with a very tough, harsh coat, and long, powerful
jaws, and weighing from over twenty to over
thirty pounds, so that it requires activity, strength and
indomitable pluck for a small dog to attempt to overcome
such an animal, possessing so many natural advantages.
I think Dachshunds are not so generally
kept as pets as they were some years since, but my experience
of them is favourable, having found them
amiable and docile in disposition, cleanly in habits, and
bright and lively in temperament. They are very long,
and low, in build, head and ears hound shaped, forelegs
curved with an outward turn, to facilitate digging
operations, tail carried rather gaily, coat fine in texture,
skin loose, colours most in favour, rich chestnut red,
black and tan, chocolate, and other shades of brown,<span class="pagenum hide"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span><span class="pagenum hide"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>

be a ground of one shade of brown, splashed with irregular
blotches of another darker shade of same colour.
Of course there are constantly springing up
new patrons and patronesses for all kinds of dogs, but
I have noticed that almost every one of the persons
who were the most enthusiastic supporters, and breeders
of Dachshunds, when they were first brought forward,
many years since, have now ceased to keep them,
although they nearly all keep some other breeds, so
that, as in my own case, I think it is not one of the
varieties which takes a lasting hold on its votaries,
whether from the fact that it is essentially one of the
foreign made breeds, and the effect of the strong preference,
which now prevails for the encouragement of
everything of British and Colonial origin and manufacture,
I do not know, but I can call to mind at least
ten of the largest breeders of Dachshunds in this country,
who, I believe, have not at present one specimen
amongst the lot.</p>

<p><i>Points of the Basset Hound.</i>&mdash;The following description
of the points desired in this breed by my
friend, the late lamented Sir Everett Millais, Bart., who
was quite an enthusiast in his support of it, may be interesting
to those of my readers who admire (and who,
that has seen them, can fail to do so?) these very
beautiful dogs:&mdash;"The Basset, for its size, has perhaps
more bone than nearly any other dog. The skull,
should be peaked, like that of the Bloodhound, with the
same dignity, and expression; nose, black, and well<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
flewed. For the size of the Hound, I think the teeth
are extremely small. However, as they are not intended
to destroy life, perhaps this is the reason. The
ears, should hang, like the Bloodhounds, and are like
the softest velvet. The eyes are deep brown, and brimful
of affection and intelligence. They are pretty
deeply set, and should show a considerable 'haw.' A
Basset, is one of those Hounds, incapable of having a
'wicked eye.' The neck, is long, but of great power,
and in the Basset à jambes torses, the flews extend very
nearly down to the chest. The chest, is more expansive
in the Basset, than even in the Bull Dog, and
should, in the Basset à jambes torses, be not more than
two inches from the ground. In the case of the Basset
à jambes demi-torses, and jambes droites, being generally
lighter, their chests do not of course come so
low. The shoulders, are of great power and terminate
in the crooked feet of the Basset, which appear to be a
mass of joints. The back and ribs, are strong, and the
former of great length, the stern, is gaily carried, like
that of Hounds in general, and when the Hound is on
the scent of game, this portion of his body gets extremely
animated, and tells me, in my own Hounds,
when they have struck a fresh, or cold, scent, and I even
know when the foremost Hound will give tongue! The
hindquarters, are very strong and muscular, the muscles
standing rigidly out, down to the hocks. The skin,
is soft in the smooth haired dogs, and like that of any
other Hound, but in the rough variety, it is identical
with that of the Otter Hound. Colour, of course, is
a matter of fancy, although I infinitely prefer the 'tri<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>colour,' which has a tan head, and black and white
body."</p>


<p><i>Points of the Dachshund.</i>&mdash;The following are set
down by my friend, Mr. A. O. Mudie, so well-known
as a successful breeder, exhibitor and judge of this
quaint-looking breed, and who has had a long experience
amongst them:&mdash;Head, long and narrow, peak
well developed. Jaw, strong, and level. Ears, set on
low, long, broad, and soft. Chest, deep, and narrow;
breastbone prominent. Forelegs, very short, and
strong in bone, well-crooked, but standing equally on
all parts of the foot. Skin, thick, and supple. Coat,
short and strong. Loins, well arched, strong and muscular.
Any colour. Long, low, and graceful, and not
cloddy."<span class="pagenum hide"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Greyhounds.</i>&mdash;This is certainly, whether quite in his
present form and appearance or not, one of the most
ancient breeds, and believed to have been kept by our
forefathers in the earliest part of the Christian era. It
is said to have been introduced into this country in the
days of Elfric, Duke of Mercia, and manuscript paintings
exist of a Saxon chief, his huntsman and a brace of
Greyhounds in the ninth century. Although not generally
credited with much more intelligence than to
view a hare and run after it until he catches it, or it gets
away, I mention later on in this book, some tales of his
sagacity which I believe are well authenticated, and will
now give a detailed description of the breed:&mdash;</p>


<p><i>Points of the Greyhound.</i>&mdash;Head, narrow and fine,
with sufficient muscle; nose should be straight (not
curved, many, otherwise good, are spoiled by "Roman
noses"); nasal sinuses not developed; eyes full and
bright, full of life; semi-erect, small, well shaped ears;
neck long, slightly curved; chest capacious, plenty of
"lung power," deep rather than wide; shoulders deep,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
narrow at top, like racehorses' shoulders in their position;
forelegs straight, well set on, well muscled; forearms,
long, strong and muscular; feet compact, and
not too long; well arched ribs; wide, large and muscular
hips; long, strong, slightly arched back; hocks
and knees placed low; coat glossy as satin (many good
"performers" however, have been the reverse of this);
Colours: white, red, brindle, blue and white, fawn,
black, red and fawn, etc., quite a matter of taste. It is
thought, by some people, that more great winners have
been produced from the blacks, and black and whites,
than from any other colours. As far as show winners
are concerned, and I have had scores of the breed before
me, I am inclined to think brindles, blacks and fawns
have been the most often the winning colours.</p>

<p><i>The Scotch Deerhound.</i>&mdash;Although I have often seen
these graceful animals (as we know was the case with
Sir Walter Scott), made inmates of the house, there
is a rugged, moorland, and, withal, business-like look
about them which gives you the idea they would be
more at home in the open air, on the heather, or the
mountain side, for choice, than in the most luxurious
house dwelling. It is some time since I had any of
them, but I was very partial to the breed, and used to
exhibit for some time, and well remember the grace and
activity often displayed by some of my specimens. I
always go and have a look at them at the shows. I am
not quite convinced they are making much progress,
just now, although undoubtedly there are good specimens.
There are so many new breeds being brought<span class="pagenum hide"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span><span class="pagenum hide"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span><span class="pagenum hide"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span><span class="pagenum hide"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>out and "pushed" forward, some of the older ones are
apt to be neglected.</p>


<p><i>The Points of Scotch Deerhound.</i>&mdash;The points of
this breed are stated by a well known breeder and exhibitor
as follows:&mdash;Head, long and narrow, tapering
gradually from the ears, knee flat; nose, black,
occasionally a blue black, and pointed, lips level,
ears small, set on high and carried in a fold, soft, silky,
and free from long hairs; neck long but strong, nape
very prominent, shoulders sloping, toes close and
arched, chest deep, body long, but well ribbed up; loins
arched with great breadth across hips, stifle well bent,
thighs long; tail set on low, curved but not coated, coat
rough and harsh on body, mane on neck and slight
fringe on inside of legs, thighs, and tail. Colours: all
shades from dark blue or black brindled, to light grey
brindled, fallow, fawn, dun and drab. White markings
often seen on chest and feet, but most objectionable.</p>

<p><i>The Irish Wolf Hound.</i>&mdash;I think nearly all persons
who take any interest in this grand old breed, stated to
have been well known to and greatly prized by "the
Romans," in old times, are aware that no one of the
present generation has devoted more time and trouble,
in diving into the history of the breed in the past, and
doing his utmost, both by experimental breeding, and
stirring up a similar ardour in others, to revive at least
some of the past glories of the breed, in the present and
future, than Captain George Graham, of Dursley, and I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
venture to make some quotations from an excellent and
interesting article of his on the subject, as being the
highest authority procurable: "<i>The form</i> of the old
Irish Wolfhound should be that of a tall, heavy Scotch
Deerhound, much more massive, and very majestic
looking, active and fast, perhaps less so than our
present breed of Deerhounds; neck thick in comparison
to his form, and very muscular, body and frame
lengthy. <i>Head</i>, long but narrow, coming to a comparative
point towards the nose, which is rather large;
and head gradually getting broader from the same
<i>evenly</i> up to the back of the skull, not sharp up to the
eyes and then suddenly broad and humpy. <i>Coat</i>,
rough, hard and long all over the body, head, legs and
tail. Hair on head, long, but rather softer than on
body, standing out boldly over eyes, beard under jaws,
very marked and wiry. Colours: black, grey, brindle,
red, and fawn, though <i>white</i> dogs were esteemed in
former times. <i>Ears</i>, small in proportion to size of
head, and erect, as in Smooth Greyhounds. If dark in
colour, to be preferred. <i>The tail</i>, should be carried with
an upward curve only, and not be curled as is the
case with many Greyhounds. <i>Size.</i> We may safely
deduce that the height of these dogs varied from thirty-two
to thirty-four inches, and even thirty-five in the
dogs, and from twenty-nine to thirty-one in the bitches.
The other dimensions would naturally be about as follows
for well shaped and true formed dogs. <i>Girth of
chest.</i> Dogs thirty-eight to forty-four inches; bitches
thirty-two to thirty-four inches. <i>Weight.</i> Dogs one-hundred
and fifteen to one hundred and forty pounds;<span class="pagenum hide"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span><span class="pagenum hide"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>bitches ninety to one hundred and fifteen pounds. <i>Girth
of forearm.</i> Dogs ten to twelve inches; bitches eight
and one-half to ten inches. <i>Length of head.</i> Dogs
twelve and one-half to fourteen inches; bitches eleven
to twelve inches. Most modern authors, and all practical
lovers of the canine race whom the writer has
consulted, are agreed that the foregoing is the correct
type of dog beyond question."</p>


<p><i>Show Points of the Irish Wolf Hound.</i>&mdash;Skull, long
but rather narrow in proportion to the animal's height
and weight, very gradually tapering to the nose, which
should be large; ears small; eyes dark hazel; neck of
fair length and very muscular; shoulders sloping, chest
rather wide and very deep; body long and very powerful,
though free from any suspicion of clumsiness; forelegs,
straight, and heavy in bone; feet, compact, and of
a good size and well padded; hindquarters, very muscular,
with bent stifles and hocks; tail carried rather
upward in similar form; coat, profuse, hard, and
weather resisting; brindle, black, or fawn are the most
usual colours, though whites <i>are</i> known. Size, as tall
as possible.</p>

<span class="caption">BORZOI, CH. &quot;ALEX&quot; H. R. H. PRINCESS of WALES, OWNER.</span>
</div>

<p><i>The Borzois.</i>&mdash;I will next deal with the Borzois,
the name of the Russian Wolf Hounds, which have
become so much more numerous of late years, and are
being patronised not only by many of the nobility and
gentry, but even by H. R. H. the Princess of Wales.
The portrait of a champion from H. R. H. kennels illustrates
this variety. I remember H. R. H. the
Prince of Wales exhibited some specimens of this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
breed a good many years ago, at Warwick, on
one of the many occasions of my judging there,
and if I remember rightly Lady Charles Innes Ker
was also an exhibitor of the breed at the same
show, but those shown by the latter, although what
would at the present day, be considered small and
weedy specimens, were more, in colour, coat and type,
like those now imported from Russia, while those then
shown by H. R. H. the Prince (although, I think,
stated to be a present to him from the then Emperor of
Russia,) were pale cream, or freestone, colour, with
harsher coats, and more altogether on the style of very
light coloured Scotch Deerhounds. I may say, however,
that for elegance, elasticity, beauty of form, and
movement, there is no breed to surpass the Borzois
and I have no doubt they will continue to increase in
popularity. The points most sought after in the breed
are:&mdash;narrow, domed, and long skulls, long, powerful
jaws, with rather arched noses, soft and intelligent expression;
very powerful, slightly arched and longish
sides, on sloping shoulders, deep but rather narrow
chests; backs rising in a gradual curve at loins, very
muscular, but appearance of being rather "tucked up;"
forelegs straight, strong and well under body; feet
close and well padded; hindquarters immensely muscular
and powerful, backs well let down, tail carried
low, in a graceful curve; coat profuse and silky looking,
colours usually white with lemon, grey or red
markings, but self-coloured specimens are often seen;
the general appearance is that of a high bred, distinguished
looking, graceful animal, something the shape<span class="pagenum hide"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span><span class="pagenum hide"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>and size of a Scotch Deerhound, but differing from it
in many respects. As I judged this breed long before
there was any club or classes provided for it, I have
always taken much interest in it, and been pleased to
see how rapidly it has come into public favour.</p>

<span class="caption">WHIPPET CH. &quot;ENTERPRISE&quot; H. VICKERS, OWNER.</span>
</div>

<p><i>The Whippet.</i>&mdash;Although their size and elegance of
shape would make them eligible, I think, the Whippet,
or "Running Dog," as he is sometimes called, is not
often kept strictly as a pet or companion, but more often
as a means of a little speculation on its fleetness of foot.
No doubt most of my readers will be aware, it is a small
sized Greyhound, rather long in head, wide between
the eyes, flat at top, jaw powerful but clean, level teeth,
bright eyes, small rose ears, long, arched neck, no
throatiness, muscular, oblique shoulders, deep chest,
strong loins, arched back, rather long and broad. Legs
straight, short and muscular thighs, feet round and well
split up, tail tapering and long, with good carriage.
Coat fine and close, colours, white, brindle, fawn, blue,
red, black, and mixtures of each. Of late years there
has been greatly revived interest taken in these dogs,
and considerable prizes have been offered for their competition.
I have noticed also a marked increase in the
entries at shows providing classes for them, and on
several occasions, at the larger shows, I have had good
classes containing many beautiful specimens of this
breed, which is so largely kept by colliers and others
of the working classes in the "Black Country."<span class="pagenum hide"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span></p>

</div>

<p><i>Fox Terriers.</i>&mdash;As this breed is associated with my
first prize, when a schoolboy, now, some years since,
but when dog shows were much rarer than "Black
Swans," were supposed to be, I have always taken
much interest in it, and have had many good specimens
of both the Smooth, and Wirehaired, varieties into
which the breed is divided. They are both very good
and both have hosts of admirers. Some of the fanciers
now exhibiting, will remember, with me, the time when
no classes were provided for the "Wirehairs," and you
had (as I have often done) to show them as "Broken-haired
Terriers," and often meet in your class nearly all
the members of that heterogeneous family, such as
Dandies, Skyes, Bedlingtons, Scottish (Airedales did
not exist then), Irish, and old English, enough to try
the temper of judge and exhibitors, and making the decision
quite a matter of the specimen best shower
and shown. But since those days, Fox Terriers have
enjoyed a long term of popularity, and so far from the
"Wirehaired" section being ignored, I have seen at
some shows more entries in it than that of their Smooth
brethren, and the figures given for high class specimens,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
are certainly not far behind, even if they are not before,
them. Of course, hundreds, in fact the great majority
of the Fox Terriers in the country, have never seen a
Fox, and probably never will, in the course of their
natural life, and (as I said of many of the Dachshunds
we see about, and the "Badgers," so I say of very
many of the Fox Terriers to be met with everywhere)
so much the better <i>for them</i>, as a Fox, <i>in his earth</i>,
which is where a Terrier is wanted to deal with him,
is not a "milk and water" animal to tackle, as a rule,
and it requires strength, perseverance, pluck and ability
on the part of his assailants. I think the following
description of the necessary points required, as expressed
by my friend Mr. Francis Redmond, well
known to many of my readers as a very successful
breeder, exhibitor, and judge of the breed, will fitly
conclude my brief notice:&mdash;"The points of greatest
importance in the Fox Terrier are: Head, ears,
legs and feet, neck, and shoulders, back, loin and hindquarters,
smartness, activity, size, and 'Terrier character.'
<i>Head.</i> The skull should be flat and moderately
narrow, broader between the ears and gradually tapering
to the eyes, free from wrinkle. But little slope, or
indentation, should be visible, except in profile. The
jaw should be clean cut, rather long, powerful and
muscular, with little or any fullness or bulging out at
the cheeks. There is a very slight falling away below
the eyes, but this must be very gradual, and not to
such an extent as to give a snipey, or wedgy, appearance.
<i>The lips</i> should be fairly tight, without any
superfluous skin. <i>The nose</i> must be quite black.<span class="pagenum hide"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span><span class="pagenumhide"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span><span class="pagenum hide"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span><span class="pagenum hide"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span><span class="pagenum hide"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span><span class="pagenum hide"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span><i>The eyes</i> should be small, not set too wide apart, neither
too much sunk, or protruding, dark-rimmed, full of
life, and intelligence. <i>The teeth</i>, strong, and level, incisors
just closing over the under ones. <i>The ears</i>, to
which great importance is attached, V shaped, rather
small, fairly thick and carried forward, flat, and close
to the cheek. <i>The neck</i> should be of fair length, clean
and muscular, well set, with shoulders tapering gradually
to head. <i>The shoulders</i>, fine at the points, long
and sloping, chest deep, narrow rather than broad.
Shoulders and chest have of late received much attention
by judges; heavy shoulders and broad chests are
no good for these dogs' work. <i>Back and loin.</i> Back
should be straight and strong, the ribs well sprung, loin
strong, wide and square, back ribs deep. Loin may
be slightly arched, but with no approach to 'wheel
back.' <i>Hindquarters</i> must be very strong, wide seen
from behind, thighs with plenty of muscle, long as well
as large, stifles slightly bent, hocks straight. Bone,
short and strong from hock to heel. <i>Stern</i> set on rather
high, carried gaily, not carried above a 'right angle'
with back; if anything, a trifle coarse. <i>Legs and feet.</i>
Point of extreme value, to which greatest attention
should be given. Elbows well let down, in straight
line with body. Forelegs, however viewed, 'straight
as gun barrels,' with upright, powerful, pasterns;
strong in bone, clothed with muscle from elbow to foot,
giving a most solid, unbroken appearance; feet, round,
and cat-like, very compact, toes short and only moderately
arched, soles hard as adamant; foot should neither
turn in or out, if any deviation, should turn in; no dew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>-claws behind. <i>The Coat</i> should be smooth, harsh in
texture, very close and abundant, a jacket to protect
wearer from all weathers. Colours: white should
predominate. Brindle, fallow, liver, or red, markings
are objectionable. <i>Size.</i> The Fox Terrier must neither
be leggy or too near the ground, neither must he be
cloddy, but should have plenty of 'liberty,' and galloping
power, with good bone and substance; fair speed
and endurance being essentially requisite for his legitimate
calling. Seventeen pounds in hard working condition
is a fair average weight, but this may vary a
pound or so either way. Make, shape, good shoulders
and chest, being far better criterions, in this respect,
than actual weight.&mdash;"</p>

<p>The above applies to "Smooth," but is also an excellent
standard for "Wirehaired Fox Terriers," which
are judged on same lines, <i>except</i> coat, which in
the latter, should be about two inches long, and very
dense, and wiry, not shaggy, or woolly, on any account.</p>

<p><i>Dandies.</i>&mdash;A very sterling and genuine breed is <i>the
Dandie Dinmont Terrier</i>, which was, I think, first
brought to public notice by the writings of Sir
Walter Scott, and as I have bred, owned, exhibited
and judged more of them than most people, I may
be allowed to say they are highly intelligent (according
to my experience, much more so than any breed of Terrier,
and I believe I have kept most of them), devoted
to their owners "born sportsmen," being always open
for anything in the way of "sport" on land or in
water, full of dash and spirit, have a quaint and pic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span><span class="pagenum hide"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span><span class="pagenum hide"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>turesque appearance, and make ideal companions for
either sex. Of course they are Scottish by birth and
origin, but, the more they are seen and known, the better
they will be liked, and they have been so much introduced
into England, and good specimens bought up,
that, at one time, even if not now, there were more good
ones in England than could be met with in any part of
Scotland. There are only supposed to be two colours
allowed in Dandies, "<i>Pepper</i>," which is a sort of pepper
and salt, composed of light and dark bluish greys,
with topknots of silvery white, and "<i>Mustard</i>," which
is a kind of pale yellowish fawn, darker on the neck
and back than below, and also with a light silvery topknot.
A Dandie of high class, of either colour, shown
in good coat and form, is a very beautiful little dog,
and fit company for the highest in the land, and, as I
said of the last breed I mentioned, may be seen in the
possession of all classes. I am not quite certain whether
Her Majesty the Queen continues to keep the breed. I
do not remember seeing any at Windsor, but I know
that in the lifetime of the late lamented Prince Consort,
there were Dandies and Skyes amongst the royal pets.
Where a person desires to keep but one dog, and wishes
to make a friend and companion of it, I do not think
that they could improve upon a Dandie, as they make
incomparable house dogs. I am speaking from a long
and intimate experience of them, as I have bred, owned,
shown and judged hundreds of them, and I have rarely
found any, who have kept them, but speak in the highest
terms of their many charming qualities, and continue
to take an interest in the breed, perhaps, long after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
they have any specimens of it left, and in many cases,
several generations of the same families have kept them
on. In build they are low to the ground, with long
bodies, short legs, possessed of great strength and endurance,
and certainly one of the most muscular breeds
of its size with which I am acquainted, their quaint,
dignified bearing, and deep bark are marked characteristics.
The following are the points of the breed, as
set out by me for publication, very many years since,
and I am not aware they have ever been altered:&mdash;Head
apparently large in proportion to size, skull fairly
wide and covered with top-knot of silky, light hair,
muzzle deep and moderately broad, jaws of great
strength, teeth level, ears not thick or wide, and feathered
to a point, eyes dark hazel, very lustrous and intelligent
(dark markings round the eyes very desirable
in Pepper Dandies), chest deep, forelegs as straight as
compatible with lowness, and, as well as in loins and
hindquarters, showing great bone and muscle, tail carried
rather gaily, weight under twenty-four pounds,
bitches under twenty-two pounds. Colours, pepper or
mustard.</p>

</div>

<p><i>Skyes</i>.&mdash;Perhaps it will be in order here to mention
their fellow countrymen, <i>the Skyes</i>, also admirably
adapted as companions and house dogs, the main advantages
Dandies can claim over them being, in carrying
less coat, and being rather more active. Although
blacks, and fawns with black points, are occasionally
seen, the predominant colours of Skyes are, undoubtedly,
various shades of grey, from light silver to dark<span class="pagenum hide"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span><span class="pagenum hide"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>iron and steel. The breed is divided into two varieties,
principally distinguished by the carriage of their ears,
and known as "Dropeared" and "Prickeared;" in the
former, the ears being rather large and pendulous to
the sides of the head, and in the latter, the ears are carried
as by the Pomeranians; each variety has its admirers,
and some, as I have done, keep both sorts, but
I think there are many more prick-eared to be seen, than
drop-eared. These dogs are more active, intelligent
and courageous than would be supposed from their appearance,
and form strong attachments to their owners.
Owing to the unsatisfactory management of one, and
the dissolution of the other, of the clubs, founded many
years since in Scotland, and England, for the encouragement
of this breed (which is another of those either
still, or formerly, favoured by royal patronage, both at
Windsor and Sandringham), things have not been
going on swimmingly, for some years past, in the Skye
world, but I know there are a few zealous breeders still
"pegging away" with their kennels, and I am in hopes
the interests and fortunes of the breed will be again
revived, and some more specimens brought forward, as
good, or better, than any seen in the past. The greatest
fault I find with nearly all the best specimens brought
out of late years, is their size, as in my opinion, and I
have probably seen all the best brought out during the
last twenty-five years, their weight should not exceed
twenty-five pounds, even with dogs, and with bitches
two or three pounds less, with preference for small,
good ones, long, low, hard in coat, strong in bone, and
muzzle, and not toys. With proper care and attention,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
a Skye may be made a most beautiful animal, as is
proved by one of the inmates of a well known kennel,
on one occasion, actually pulling off, and on another,
getting placed "Reserve," for the highest possible
honour at a first class London show, where all the competitors
were champions of their several varieties.</p>

<p>The points in Skyes are usually considered to be as
follows: Head long with powerful jaws and level
teeth. Skull wide in front, narrowing between ears
and tapering gradually towards muzzle, with little falling
in between or behind the eyes. Eyes, close set,
medium size, dark hazel. Muzzle always black. Ears
pendant, or pricked, in the former full and well feathered,
lying close to face in front, and in the latter standing
bolt upright, with a little feathering at the tip,
standing towards each other at inner edges from peak
to skull. Body, preeminently long and low, shoulders
broad, chest deep, ribs oval shaped, and well sprung,
giving flattish appearance to sides. Hindquarters and
flanks full and well developed. Level back. Neck
long and slightly crested; tail, when raised, a prolongation
of the incline of the back, gracefully feathered
on lower side, and not rising higher or curling
over back. Legs, short, straight and muscular, without
dew claws. Feet rather large and pointing forward.
Under coat, short, close, soft and woolly. Over
coat, hard, straight, flat and crisp, averaging five and
one-half inches long. Hair on head shorter, softer,
and veiling forehead and eyes; on ears, overhanging,
inside falling down and mingling with side locks, not
heavily, but surrounding the ear like a fringe, and<span class="pagenum hide"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span><span class="pagenumhide"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>

blue, grey, or steel, or fawn with black points. Weight
<i>not</i> exceeding twenty-four pounds, a few pounds less,
better than any higher, as so many good specimens are
spoilt by being coarse, at least, this is my opinion, after
considerable practical experience of the breed, and
being one of its staunchest admirers.</p>

<p><i>Scottish Terriers.</i>&mdash;One of the misfortunes of being
a "general lover of animals," is that you can never tell
which sort you like best, there are so many breeds, I
have bred and exhibited, and I think all breeds I have
judged, and I am identified with so many, which are
presumed to be my "prime favourites," but, it is a
positive fact, although I have never before mentioned
it, that, some of the breeds, in which, I have had the
largest entries, for years and years, were taken up by
me, so warmly, because, I thought them in "low
water," and in danger of extinction without they were
encouraged, that they were not at all favourites of
mine. But I do not intend to disclose preference for
any particular variety, beyond what my friends may
know, or others may gather from the contents of this
book, but this I will say of the <i>Scottish Terrier</i>, that
if I was not the first, as mentioned hereafter in my
"Doggy Anecdotes," in this work, to introduce him
into this country, more than twenty-five years since,
I must have been <i>one</i> of the earliest, as I never saw
one here until long after arrival of my "<i>Fraochen</i>"
(whose life-like picture, coming through the underwood
with a Rabbit in his mouth, hangs by me while I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
pen these lines!). As I said of the Dandie, and might
say of the Irish Terrier, that where a man, <i>or woman</i>,
for that matter, as they are capital specimens for either
sex, wants to keep only one dog, <i>they cannot better</i>
one of those three breeds. They are as true as steel,
devoted as "pals," and faithful <i>as dogs</i>! The great
uniformity of type, and character, now seen in the large
classes of these game and picturesque-looking little
fellows, at the larger shows, proves the amount of care
and attention which has been devoted to them by breeders,
<i>within</i> the last quarter of a century. The usual
colours are, shades of black, dark grey and grizzle, and
sometimes stone colour. My friend, the late Capt.
Keen, made an effort to introduce whites, but I do not
think it came to much. Although, I am glad to say,
the enthusiasm for the breed in "North-Britain," has
not abated, not a few good specimens, and to my certain
knowledge (for I have the pleasure of numbering
them amongst my friends), not a few keen fanciers of
"Scottish Terriers," exist on <i>this</i> side of "the border,"
and it is always my wish, with them, when they meet,
as with every other kind of "stock," in rivalry, "may
the best win, and the loser do his best to turn the tables
next time." With these few remarks on a breed on
which much more could be said, if space and time permitted,
I will give: <i>The Points of the Scottish Terrier</i>.&mdash;Skull
of good length, rather inclined to be
curved in shape, covered with short hair, and showing
a drop between the eyes; muzzle, very powerful, and
not too pointed; nose, large and black; teeth, extremely
large; eyes, dark, small, piercing in expression, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
very bright; ears, very small, sharp at the corners, and
carried erect; neck, short, and powerful; chest, rather
wide, and very deep; body, only moderately long, and
very powerful at the loins; forelegs, straight, short,
and heavy in bone, with small, compact feet, well padded
with hair between the toes; hindquarters very muscular
and the hocks well bent; tail of fair length and
carried rather gaily; coat, very harsh, and weather resisting;
colours, dark grey, black, brindle, red or
wheaten. Much white marking being very objectionable.<span class="pagenum hide"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span></p>

<p><i>St. Bernards.</i>&mdash;Although apparently so much removed
from the breeds, I have been deeply associated
with for the last twenty-five years, I am bound to say I
have always been a great admirer of St. Bernards, and
can well remember many years ago, at a show held at
Laycock's Dairy Yard, Islington, being struck with admiration
at the team shown there by Mr. Cumming
Macdona (at that time, and for some years later, "a
name to conjure with" in the St. Bernard world), and
afterwards I was a great admirer of my friend Mr.
Gresham's Hector and Abbess (two of the best I had
seen in possession of one owner) and many more, too
numerous to mention. I am inclined to think the breed
is not quite as popular as it was some years since, and
that the entries at most of our best shows are neither as
large, nor as good, as they were. The points desired are
as follows:&mdash;The head very massive and large, showing
great depth from eye to lower jaw; the face rather
short; muzzle wide, deep, and cut off square; the lips
should hang down well and be rather loose; the "stop"
well defined, but not too abrupt; the skull massive and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
well rounded, eyes dark in colour, of medium size,
rather deeply set, the lower eyelid drooping slightly, so
as to show a little of the red haw; ears rather small,
lying well to the cheek, and very slightly feathered in
the Rough variety; nose black in colour, wide and
deep; legs very straight, with great bone and muscle,
hocks and stifle well bent; feet large and compact;
body rather long, broad, straight and ribs well rounded.
The coat of the Smooth or Short-coated variety, should
be very close, thick and slightly brokenhaired. In the
Rough variety the coat should be dense and flat, of
medium length, not woolly, rather longer on the neck,
thighs and tail. Colour and markings: orange, orange
and tawny, and all shades of brindle, and red; the
markings should be as follows:&mdash;White muzzle, white
blaze up face, the white being shaded with black, also
black shadings on the ears, white collar round neck,
white chest, legs and tip of tail. The body may be
white with patches of any of above colours.</p>

<p><i>Newfoundlands.</i>&mdash;There are few of the non-sporting
breeds which have received more notice in the newspapers
than the Newfoundland dog, being so often associated
with saving of life on the sea coasts, or on the
banks of some of our rivers, and I think there are few,
if any, dogs so really and naturally fond of the water,
and being possessed of strength and courage, they are
often able to render valuable aid. At one time I feared
they were becoming almost extinct, and I think the
many and very beautiful specimens we now see at our
shows, are mainly due to my old friend, Mr. Edwin<span class="pagenum hide"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span><span class="pagenum hide"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>

warmly some years ago, and became one of the most
shining lights in the Newfoundland world. I remember,
his ideas of the points to be sought after were as follows:&mdash;Head
to be broad and massive, with a flat skull
and somewhat square muzzle; ears small, in proportion
to size of the animal, and lying close to the head; coat
straight, dense and capable of resisting water; tail
carried gaily, but not curled over the back. Colours:
black, black and white, or bronze. Average weights,
one hundred pounds for dogs and eighty-five pounds
for bitches. General appearance that of a dignified,
thoughtful, and thoroughly reliable guard, companion,
or friend, with a great deal of character.</p>

<p><i>The Mastiff.</i>&mdash;This, which is usually considered one
of the National breeds of this kingdom, is a splendid
fellow, stylish and imperious in manner and bearing,
and fit to be the associate of the very highest in the
land. I don't think I can do better than quote the
opinion of Mr. M. B. Wynn, whom I well remember as
a frequent exhibitor, breeder and judge of this variety,
some years ago. He says:&mdash;"What I consider a true
type of the British Mastiff. Head, this is the most
important feature, it should be broad between ears, and
broad between the eyes. The "stop" should extend
up the face to a considerable length; forehead wrinkled
and flat; cheeks very prominent; muzzle broad, blunt
and heavy, and as deep as possible; profile square, and
the under jaw, if any thing, to be undershot; eyes small
and to be deeply set, with a deal of loose skin down the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
sides of the face; ears small and either half erect, or
wholly pendant, and thin to the touch. Body: Chest
deep and thick through, broad between forelegs; loin,
broad, flat, heavy; body long. Stern: Many good
breeders prefer a long one, but I do not care for it to
reach much below the hock. Legs, broad, round, massive,
straight. Height: this is a much disputed point.
The taller the better, provided the weight corresponds
in proportion. A dog standing twenty-eight inches
high, ought to weigh in good condition one hundred
and twenty-five pounds, and for every inch in height
above that (<i>i. e.</i>, twenty-eight inches) the weight ought
to increase from eight to ten pounds. But over thirty
inches, a still greater increase, in proportion. Many
good dogs are only twenty-eight and twenty-nine inches
high, but from thirty-one to thirty-three are to be desired.
Height should ever be accompanied with massive
build and length, and should proceed from the
shoulder to the elbow, rather than from the elbow to the
foot. I mean the height of the dog should be derived
from the depth of the chest, rather than from "over-legginess,"
as this must tend to develop the weight,
more or less, of the whole animal. Colour, after all, is
the last requisite, since you may breed in a few generations,
any colour you please. The purest fawns have
descended from the most decided brindles, and from
time to time, the white face, especially, has and will
occur, and generally in the finest specimens, and those
which most closely resemble the paintings of their progenitors.
I am an advocate for fineness of coat, but
not at the expense of other more characteristic features.<span class="pagenum hide"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span><span class="pagenum hide"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Points of the Mastiff.</i>&mdash;The show points of this
breed have been set out as follows:&mdash;Head large and
massive, skull flatly rounded, muzzle square, broad and
deep, teeth level, eyes dark brown or hazel coloured and

<p><i>The Dalmatian.</i>&mdash;This is a breed I have bred and
kept for many years and I have had the pleasure of judging
some of the largest classes of them ever seen, if I
remember rightly, having nearly sixty entries on one
occasion, at the Crystal Palace, and large classes at the
Royal Agricultural Hall, Earl's Court, Birmingham and
other places. At one time they got down to a very low
ebb, in numbers, but I think they are now coming forward
again, as I had a very good lot before me at the
last show of the Kennel Club. I think they have more
of the Pointer type than that of any other breed about
them although I have used them entirely as companions
and guards, and there is no doubt they have a
natural talent as carriage dogs, and are very fond of
horses; I know they are exclusively used in Italy and
other parts of the Continent of Europe for sporting
purposes, and they are often included in troupes of performing
dogs, in some of which I have seen very accomplished
specimens, seeming to adapt themselves to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
the work, particularly of a humorous character, with
much spirit and to be easily trained. Of course, as
show dogs, their markings are of great importance. I
have for some time been trying to bring forward more
specimens of the liver, as well as the black, spotted
variety, which is now so seldom seen. Prince 4th, and
his handsome son, Champion Fauntleroy, a capital portrait
of whom illustrates this variety, and the bitch
Doncaster Beauty, are the three best of that colour, I
have seen for many years, while Fawdry's Captain and
Leaho, my Lurth and Leah, and Wilson's Acrobat and
Parker's Coming Still, and Champion Berolina (formerly
Wilson's), as well as Hartley's Treasure, are the
best of the black spotted variety seen for a very long
time. I have found them very docile and affectionate
as well as more intelligent than many people suppose,
from seeing them running behind a carriage.</p>

<p><i>Points of the Show Dalmatian.</i>&mdash;The points of this
breed are, longish head, flat skull, with moderate stop;
long and powerful muzzle; medium sized eyes, dark
for black spotted, and light for the liver spotted variety;
ears rather small, white with black or liver markings,
carried close to head; nose black or liver, according to
markings on body; neck arched and fairly long, without
throatiness; very deep but not wide chest; powerful
back and well ribbed body; muscular loins and
straight legs, compact, well padded feet; slightly
curved, tapering tail, with markings on it same colour
as on body, carried rather gaily with an upward curve;
coat dense, harsh and short. Ground colour, white,<span class="pagenum hide"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span><span class="pagenum hide"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>pure, with spots on body, ears and tail, size of a shilling
or larger, clear and distinct, not mixed or blurred,
colour of spots to be rather intense black, or a rich liver.
Weight from fifty to fifty-five pounds. General appearance
to be that of a showy, stylish, powerful and
upstanding dog (too many of even the good specimens
shown, are too small, in my opinion), much of the
Pointer type, but higher on leg and altogether larger.
They should have a close, fine coat, which if kept in
proper order, should have almost such a shiny appearance
as you see on a well groomed horse, they are very
lively, cleanly, affectionate, and much more intelligent
animals, than is generally supposed, and as they are
exceedingly active, and fond of exercise, to those persons
who like a cheerful comrade, willing and able,
besides being an excellent guard, to accompany them on
their journeys on foot, on horseback, or when driving,
or even on bicycle, when the travelling is at a moderate
pace, I think a Dalmatian would be suitable.<span class="pagenum hide"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span></p>

<p><i>The Rough-coated Collie</i> is a very beautiful and interesting
breed, of a highly nervous temperament, very
intelligent, and capable of much training for the performance
of his natural work with the flocks. Those
who have seen him, at the Sheepdog trials, which are
frequently held in various parts of the country, but
more particularly in Wales, can testify to the patience,
care, judgment and discretion, shown by many of the
competitors, who, in these cases, have usually three
strange sheep to conduct a long distance, over a course
marked out by flags on small posts stuck in the ground
at intervals, and put them into a small pen, usually
made of three hurdles, at the end of the course, no one
being allowed to accompany the dogs during the trial,
but merely to give directions from a distance, by voice
or gestures. I am inclined to think the Scotch Collie
is, at the present time, nearly the most popular breed
of dog in the United Kingdom, and a really first class
specimen, good in head, ears, eyes, shape, size, coat,
colour and brush, is very valuable. This is another
breed favoured in high places, Her Majesty The Queen,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
the Princess of Wales (one of whose specimens illustrates
this variety), the Countess of Warwick, and
many more distinguished persons too numerous to particularize,
being amongst those who have extended
their patronage to this favourite breed of dog. The
points to be desired in this breed, are as follows:&mdash;Long
head, skull not too wide or round, obliquely set
eyes, dark and expressive, small ears, set rather far back
and high, raised semi-erect, technically known as half-pricked,
when excited, with points slightly forward and
hanging down; frame sinewy, active and well knit;
deep but wide in chest; straight forelegs, feathered at
back, with well bent hocks, strong compact feet; dense
undercoat of warm, woolly hair, with coat of hard hair
over, intensely full over the shoulders, neck and chest,
tail carried in a graceful curve and not over back, profusely
feathered on lower side, colours usually shades
of black, sable grey, blue and red, with or without
white; size from forty-five to sixty-five for dogs, and
for bitches something less. The general appearance
of a strong, active and very intelligent dog, eager and
ready to obey his master's orders.</p>

<p>I must not omit to mention the <i>Smooth Collie</i>,
another variety. I have long bred and kept it. It
also is distinguished for its great activity. I remember,
in particular, one merle bitch of this breed I
had who would run up a rough stone wall ten feet
high, like a cat, and jump down the other side, and I
have frequently seen her take a run and go over the
large wooden doors leading into my stable yard; <i>she</i>
was a marvel, but I have had many others, who have<span class="pagenum hide"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span><span class="pagenum hide"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>surprised me by their athletic performances. Some
of the most intelligent work of any breed of sheep dog
has been done by Smooth Collies. A black and light
brown bitch, of what I may call Bloodhound colour,
which I had some years since (her portrait illustrates
this variety), had again and again beaten all competitors
and taken gold and silver medals at Sheep Dog
trials in England and Wales, and was superior in intelligence
to most "two-legged animals" of any variety.
If in charge of a flock of sheep, on a narrow road,
or lane, and they got jammed, she would either jump
the wall or hedge, at side, and run down to head them,
or run over their backs to the front, and drive them
back to clear the course, and she knew what was said to
her almost before it was uttered. The appearance of
this breed is much like that of the Rough, or Scotch
Collie, except that the coat is short and sleek, ears
pricked and without feathering on them or the legs;
and the tail, with only a slight fringe of hair on its
lower side. The favoured colours are merle (which
is a sort of mottled grey, black and blue), black
and white, tricolour, and what I have before mentioned
as Bloodhound colour, being black on the
back, and light tan-coloured brown all the rest of the
body, and it is considered an advantage, rather
than otherwise, for one or both of the eyes to be
"wall," or china, coloured. Having used them for
work, as companions, guards, and as house pets, I can
speak very highly of Smooth Collies, which, I think,
are more kept in the north of England and in Wales,
particularly the South, than in any other parts of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
country, but I also think that if they were more known,
they would be more kept, as they have many advantages
in their favour, and, like other short-coated
breeds, their change of coat is hardly perceptible,
whereas we know how very unsightly is any long-coated
breed of dog when "out of coat." The points
of this breed are the same as in the Rough-coated
variety, except in coat.</p>


<p><i>Bobtail Sheep Dogs.</i>&mdash;Another very favourite breed
with many is the <i>Old English</i>, also called the Short-tailed,
more commonly known as "<i>Bobtailed</i>" <i>Sheep
Dogs</i>, and, except for being rather large, and carrying
a heavy coat, both of which are objections in a house,
they are very agreeable companions, as they are very
warm, in fact devoted, in their affections, capital
guards, quick to learn and carry out their owner's
wishes, well able to take care of themselves in any difference
with <i>any other breed</i> of dogs, and so marvellously
active, and muscular, that I have seen a "Bobtail"
win prizes in open jumping competition with <i>all</i>
other breeds. To look at them no one would have the
slightest idea of their lively and active character. I
have had a great deal to do with them, having kept and
bred them for many years, and almost my earliest remembrance
of any kind of dog, is connected with a
shaggy old customer of this breed called "Billie," belonging
to a very old friend of mine, at a Somersetshire
farm, with whom I was on the closest terms of
friendship, and whose companionship used to impart a
strong "doggy" odour to my garments on the occa<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
<span class="pagenum hide"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span><span class="pagenum hide"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>sions of my visiting him. I am very pleased to say,
that this breed, which had been much neglected on account
of the influx of Scotch Collies, and was even in
danger of becoming almost extinct, has been very
much taken up the last few years, and even in London
you now often see very decent specimens accompanying
fashionable ladies and carriages. It may not be
generally known, but I have proved it by actual practice
with a great many of my own specimens, that a
"Bobtail" is a capital dog to follow carriage, trap, or
a rider on horseback. I have come many miles, on the
darkest nights, across country roads and lanes, with a
couple following me, and never knew an instance
where they missed me, or failed to turn up at the end
of the journey, and the same in the crowded streets of
a large city I often visit. It is supposed to be one of
the oldest breeds of dog we have, and in one of Shakespeare's
old English comedies, which was lately
mounted in unusually first class style, and with many
novel realistic effects, by a popular and well known
manager at a West End theatre, a quaint old shepherd
appeared on the stage accompanied by a rugged Bobtail,
who made herself quite at home in her novel surroundings,
and gave a great finish to the scene. The
Bobtail in question was lent by me, and is the sister of a
well known "Champion" belonging to one of the most
successful exhibitors and spirited buyers of Sheep dogs
in the United Kingdom. The points of this breed, as
show specimens, are:&mdash;Head square and large, eyes
rather small and dark, but wall or marble eyes are
considered an advantage when obtainable, particularly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
in light coloured specimens, body should be large and
powerful, without coarseness, sloping rather to front;
legs straight, very strong and muscular, well covered
with hair down to toes, hindquarters high and heavy,
ears small for size of animal, neatly set on side of
head, densely coated with a harsh, straight and broken
coat, of weather-resisting character, colours very various,
but shades of blue, particularly that known as
pigeon blue, mixed with white, especially on head,
chest and forelegs, most desired, weight forty-five to
fifty-five pounds.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Amongst</span> the most popular breeds of late years, has
been one that would not be generally expected to be
found in that capacity, although it is a very old and national
breed. Perhaps I should say that, in reference to
all the companionable breeds I have mentioned in these
articles, I mean more especially kept by ladies, as when
one speaks of such dogs, one naturally thinks of animals
not chained to a dog box, or shut up in a kennel
outside, but brought into the house, and, literally
"treated as one of the family." I refer to the
<i>Bull Dog</i>, and having owned and had to do with
a great many of these, I can testify to their usual good
temper and placidity of disposition, in spite of the
many unfavourable comments we frequently hear
about them. Indeed, it is a rare thing to meet
with a bad tempered Bull dog, and the majority
of them will submit to great liberties being taken, even
by smaller dogs, rather than attempt to take their own
part, and have little idea of fighting in the style practised
by some other breeds. But if they once make up
their minds to go for any person, or animal, they are
difficult to dislodge when they have taken hold. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
sizes are very various, the dogs running from under
forty pounds to over fifty-five pounds, and
the bitches from under thirty-five to under fifty
pounds, and of late years a class of "Toy Bull
dogs" have been brought out, which I mention elsewhere.
The head large, small ears, rather prominent
eyes, very short nose, chin rather turned up and generally
pugilistic look of the face, with the body rather
heavy in front, swung between legs placed widely
apart, back short and curved, technically called
"roached," with mean hindquarters and a short tail,
with a downward turn in it if not "screwed," are
familiar features of the breed to most people knowing
anything of it, and the colours are white, white and
brindle, white and Hound tan, white and black, brindle,
brindle and white, brindle and fallow, fawn with black
muzzle, fawn and white, red, red and white, red and
black, black, and black and white. Of course the brindles,
reds, and fawns run into different shades of each,
but I think the foregoing contain nearly all the colours
allowed by the Bull Dog Clubs. It is a fascinating
breed, and when once it has been taken up, is seldom
altogether dropped, and I have known several generations
of the same family keeping up the strain. I
should say the mortality amongst Bull Dogs is as great
as, or probably greater than, in <i>any other breed</i> of dog,
particularly before they are a year old. Whether their
being so much inbred, to preserve certain characteristics,
or being so short faced as to interfere with their
organs of respiration, are the causes, I will not pretend
to say, but if you ask any breeder, he will tell you what<span class="pagenum hide"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span><span class="pagenum hide"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>considerable losses he suffers every year. Another
difficulty which would not be suspected, is that many of
them are such bad "doers," that is, do not seem to
have any appetite for their food. I remember congratulating
an enthusiast of the breed on the condition
of his favourite, a large brindle and white, at least fifty
pounds weight. "Yes," he said, "he is looking well,
but for the last fortnight he has been living entirely on
veal cutlets." I thought he would be an expensive
boarder on such fare, but from my experience of the
breed and its owners, I doubt very much if <i>any other
kind of dog</i> is so much pampered. They are naturally
slow and lazy in their movements, do not, as a rule,
take much exercise, or go much into the open air, so
have not much healthy appetite, but as a <i>thin</i> Bull Dog
is an abomination, their "condition" <i>must</i> be kept up.</p>

<p><i>Bull Terrier.</i>&mdash;The Bull Terrier, formerly so much
used in combats with others of the same variety,
(now happily things of the past, except "on the
quiet" at some of the less reputable public houses
in out of the way spots), has always been a prime
favourite with the younger members of the sporting
fraternity, on account of his undaunted courage, activity,
lively disposition, and neat "business-like" appearance.
He has been much affected by the stoppage
of "cropping the ears," and they are only now beginning
to produce specimens with small, well-carried,
drop ears, which take off much of the fierce expression
they formerly wore, and make them more presentable
to the general public. For my own part, and I have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
had many good specimens in my time, I do not care for
them being too big. I think twenty-five pounds quite
heavy enough, even for a dog, but I have often seen
them at shows nearly or quite double that weight, when
to my mind, they become coarse and unwieldy, whereas
such a breed should be active, bright and lively, as well
as shapely and stylish in appearance. In colour he
should be pure white, although I have seen and owned
many otherwise nearly perfect specimens, with markings,
usually lemon or brindled, on some part of head
or body. The following are the points laid down by
Mr. S. E. Shirley, President of the Kennel Club, who
used to own some grand specimens:&mdash;The head should
be long; the forehead flat, the eyes small, round, keen,
and as dark as possible, any approach to a light or hazel
coloured eye, being very objectionable; the jaws should
be quite level, strong and muscular; the muzzle fine
and tapering from the eyes; the nose quite black; the
neck, long and well set into strong, sloping shoulders;
the chest wide and deep; the legs very straight, strong
and powerful; the feet small and round; the back strong
and short; the tail, which is or should be a great
point in the Bull Terrier, should be moderately fine,
at the root, gradually tapering to the point, it should
be set on rather low, and carried in a gay, jaunty manner,
neither high nor low, not "hooped," or with the
slightest inclination to twist or "screw."</p>

<p><i>The Boston Terrier.</i>&mdash;By the kindness of a correspondent

taken the trouble to supply some authentic details of<span class="pagenum hide"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span><span class="pagenum hide"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>this breed of which so little is known amongst Englishmen,
but which are sure to be of much interest to the
many fanciers and admirers of the variety, I have much
pleasure in giving the actual words of my correspondent
in the following description and standard of show
points of the Boston Terrier.</p>


<p>"<i>Concerning the earlier dogs of the breed.</i>&mdash;How
did the breed originate? It resulted from a cross between
the English Bull dog and the English Terrier,
and these two have been considerably inbred. Accidental
peculiarities of the first dogs used as sires are
partly responsible for the present type. About 30
years ago Mr. Robert C. Hooper, of Boston, Mass., U.
S. A., came into possession of a dog named Judge who
was imported from England. This dog known as
Hooper's Judge was destined to be the ancestor of the
true modern Boston Terrier. He was a cross between
an English Bull dog and an English Terrier, leaning
in type rather more toward the Bull dog. Judge was
bred to Gyp, or Kate, a white bitch, owned by Ed.
Burnett, of Southboro, Mass. She weighed twenty
pounds, had a fine three-quarter tail low stationed,
stocky-build, showing strength in her make-up, good
head, being short and blocky. From Judge and Gyp
descended Well's Eph. Eph was mated to Tobin's
Kate, weighing twenty pounds, short head, golden
brindle in colour, and straight three-quarter tail. From
Well's Eph and Tobin's Kate came Barnard's Tom,
the <i>first</i> dog with a screw tail. This dog Tom was a
great improvement over his sire and grandsire, beside<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
being the <i>first</i> to show the fine quality that is present in
a good specimen of the modern Boston Terrier&mdash;Tom
was the best Boston Terrier of his day, so, of course,
was much used in stud. The above gives very briefly
the main facts concerning the older dogs of this breed.
To correct an idea that has become somewhat prevalent,
it can here be stated that the dog is in no sense
a fighting dog. While he is plucky as might be expected
from his ancestry, he is not quarrelsome or aggressive&mdash;is

<p>Show points and standard of the Boston Terrier,
furnished by an enthusiastic American fancier of the
breed.</p>


<p><i>General Appearance.</i>&mdash;The general appearance of
the Boston Terrier is that of a smooth, short-coated,
compactly built dog of medium stature. The head
should indicate a high degree of intelligence, and
should be in proportion to the dog's size, the body
rather short and well knit, the limbs strong and finely
turned, no feature being so prominent that the dog appears
badly proportioned. The dog conveys an idea of
determination, strength and activity&mdash;style of a high
order, carriage easy and graceful.</p>

<p>Skull&mdash;Broad and flat without prominent cheeks,
and forehead free from wrinkles.</p>

<p>Stop&mdash;Well defined but indenture not too deep.</p>

<p>Eyes&mdash;Wide apart, large and round, neither sunken

<p><i>The Irish Terrier.</i>&mdash;There is scarcely any breed of
any of the many varieties of the Terrier, which has
grown more in popularity during the last twenty years,
than this. And I believe it has done so strictly on its
merits; of course, somewhat helped by the ardour and
zeal of his excitable and genial fellow-countrymen, who
have done all in their power to help on one of their
"national breeds." From the points hereafter given,
my readers will get a good description of the breed. I
may say that my experience of it, <i>personally</i>, was chiefly
in some I bought of my friend, Mr. W. Graham, of
Belfast, (so much known and liked in English as well
as Irish doggy circles, and the breeder and exhibitor of
some of the best specimens of the breed ever seen).
The only reason we "parted company," was their talent
for "boxing." If I had a dozen or more dogs out peaceably
enjoying themselves in a paddock, the moment
"the Irishmen" were let out, there were "ructions,"
and they could not content themselves with just a
friendly bout amongst themselves, or with some of the
Dandies, Skyes, or others, near their own size and
weight, but must needs go and pick a quarrel with some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
of the Collies, Bobtails or other larger dogs, and I
feared they would be killed, so got rid of them, though
they were all right with all of us, and indeed great favourites.
The following description of the breed is by
my friend, Mr. L. I. Barnett, so well known as Secretary
of the English Section of the Irish Terrier Club,
and a frequent judge:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Points of the Irish Terrier.</i>&mdash;"Head long, rather
narrow; punishing jaw; eyes, small and dark; ears
fairly small, not set on too high; legs straight, and
strong; feet, round, and thick, with good heels; chest
narrow, with good depth of brisket; back strong, and
straight, with tail set on rather high; loins strong;
neck, strong, and muscular; coat very hard, and
straight, shorter on head; colour yellow-red, darker
on ears; expression, 'wicked,' but intelligent."</p>

<span class="caption">AIREDALE TERRIER CH. &quot;DUMBARTON LASS&quot; A. E. JENNINGS OWNER.</span>
</div>

<p><i>Airedales.</i>&mdash;Another breed I see occasionally kept
is the <i>Airedale Terrier</i>, which are seldom less than
forty pounds weight, and often much more. As guards,
or companions, they are admirable, and follow a trap
well, and can look after their own welfare, but although
they have been immensely improved since they
were first brought out, in the North of England, as
"The Waterside Terrier," there is, to my mind, a
coarse and common look about them, that seems to
keep them more associated with a breed suitable to accompany
his master's trap or cart, or to mount guard
over premises liable to be attacked by burglars, and its
size always seems to me much to its disadvantage, in<span class="pagenum hide"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span><span class="pagenum hide"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>

members of the different varieties of "Terriers." The
long shaped head, small ears, dark hazel eyes, strong,
well-knit body, with docked tail, and the colour grizzled
black above, and light tan below, will be familiar
to most readers of these words. I have known
many beautiful Airedales, some of them (except
in size) nearly perfect in their Terrier character,
and on the occasions I have judged the breed I have
had excellent entries of good quality, and I know now
many who keep them, and prefer them to any other
breed of dog. I am bound, however, to say I have
never been very much taken up with them, as I object
to their size as being too big to be classed amongst Terriers
for the work of that variety.</p>

<p><i>The Bedlington.</i>&mdash;This breed, which first appeared at
Darlington Dog show in 1866, had existed in the
extreme north of England, for nearly or quite fifty
years before that, and has always been more bred and
kept in the north than in any other part of the country,
although I have occasionally seen good specimens
elsewhere. The following extract from a letter published
in "The Field" in March, 1869, from a staunch
supporter of the breed, will be of interest to some of my
readers. "The Bedlington Terrier is fast, and whether
on land, or in water, is equally at home; in appetite,
these dogs are dainty, and they seldom fatten; but experience
has shown them to be wiry, enduring, and, in
courage, equal to the bull dog. They will face almost
anything, and I know of a dog which will extinguish a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
candle or lighted paper at his master's bidding! To
these other good qualities may be added, their marked
intelligence, and hostility to vermin of all kinds. They
will encounter the otter, fox, badger, with the greatest
determination. The points of the Bedlington Terrier,
which is a very lively member, as a rule, are as
follows: Skull narrow and domed, and adorned with
a silky top-knot; jaws very strong and punishing
and lips tight; nose large and either black or liver-coloured,
according to shade of the coat, eyes small and
rather deeply sunk, their colour following that of
body, ears fine, filbert shaped, tipped with soft silky hair
and carried flat against the sides of the head, neck long
and shoulders sloping, body rather narrow at the chest,
but deep at this point, ribs flat, slightly arched at the
loins, which should be powerful, legs straight, feet of
fair size, hindquarters graceful looking and not too
heavy, tail tapering almost all the way from base, carried
in a curve like a Turkish Sword; coat much as a
Dandie's, linty, composed of a mixture of hard and soft
hair. Colours blue liver or sandy, or mixtures of above
with tanned markings, pure self colours preferred and
any white objectionable. General appearance that of a
particularly alert and active dog of immense energy and
courage, and quite prepared to take his own part, with
any dog of any breed.</p>

</div>

<p><i>The Welsh Terrier.</i>&mdash;Another handy sized breed
for pet or companion and a smart guard is the
Welsh Terrier, which is practically a wire-haired
black and tan terrier, not over twenty pounds, and<span class="pagenum hide"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span><span class="pagenum hide"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span><span class="pagenum hide"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span><span class="pagenum hide"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>often less, in weight, head flat and wider at base,
eyes set rather wide, muzzle longish, and a bit
stronger than usually seen in Fox Terriers, ears small,
with forward carriage, neck clean and not short, muscular
thighs and well-boned, straight, fore-legs, coat
(black, or grizzle and tan, in colour) wiry, hard and
dense, should have no white spots, or markings. They
are very smart, showy dogs and usually very keen on
anything in the vermin, or sporting line, and are being
bred very true to type by some of their patrons, many
of whom are very enthusiastic in their praise.</p>


<p><i>The Old English Terrier.</i>&mdash;A breed closely resembling
these are the <i>Old English Terriers</i>, usually
rather larger and more grizzled in colour than
their Welsh brethren, and very suitable, being something
like a small Airedale in appearance, as companions
or house guards. The considerable interest
taken in Airedales and Welsh Terriers, (both of which
have one or more specialist clubs to look after their interests
and push them forward) has been rather prejudicial
to the Old English Terriers, which have been
somewhat neglected, but I should like to see someone
take them up, as there is much of "general utility"
about them, and they should not be allowed to die out.</p>

<span class="caption">BLACK &amp; TAN TERRIER CH. STARKIE BEN L<sup>T.</sup> COL. C. S. DEAN. OWNER.</span>
</div>

<p><i>The Black and Tan Terrier.</i>&mdash;Another well-known
breed is the Manchester or Black and Tan Terrier,
which, some years since, enjoyed considerable popularity,
and I think the main cause of its decline,
was its getting into the hands of some un<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>scrupulous members of the community, who dyed,
faked, and "rang the changes," as it was called,
with them, to such an extent, that respectable people
were afraid to have anything to do with them. I have
no doubt that the cropping edict has also been against
them, as formerly, if a dog had large, or ugly ears, their
appearance was often improved in the cropping, but
now, unless the ears are naturally small, good specimens
have little chance in the keen competition of these dogs.
I need hardly describe them as fine-coated, rather
snake-headed dogs with bright eyes of dark colour, and
marked with tan, which should be clear in shade on the
legs, thighs, feet, and other parts. They are well
adapted as pets and companions, being smart, lively and
intelligent in their manners and cleanly and vigilant in
their habits. The points of the Manchester or Black
and Tan Terrier are rather elaborate and run as follows:
Head long and narrow, flat from the back to the
nose and with no humps at sides or cheek, muzzle long
and tapering, but not weak, eyes small and oval shaped,
black and bright. The correct carriage of the ears is a
debatable point since cropping has been abolished, but
probably the drop ear is correct; neck light and graceful,
shoulders sloping, chest rather narrow but deep and
the body slightly arched with good back ribs; forelegs
quite straight with well arched toes and jet black toenails,
powerful hindquarters with hocks well let
down, tail very fine and carried almost straight, coat
short, yet close. Colour: Lustrous blue black, with
rich mahogany tan markings along the jaws, under the
throat, over the eyes, on the cheeks, inside the ears, on<span class="pagenum hide"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span><span class="pagenum hide"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>each side of breast, on the inside of the hind legs, under
the vent and on the forelegs up to above the pastern
joint. The toes, however, have black lines called "pencilling,"
running up them and there is a black spot called
the thumb mark just along the pastern joint in front
of the limb. The general appearance is that of a high
class and well-bred, smart and neat-looking dog well
suited for any work, coming into the sphere of a terrier,
and a fit companion or guard for either sex, or any rank
of life. He can adapt himself to the cottage, or the palace,
and look well in either.</p>

<span class="caption">WHITE ENGLISH TERRIER. CH. ECLIPSE J. WALSH. OWNER.</span>
</div>

<p><i>The White English Terrier</i>&mdash;I may here mention
what is doubtless a branch of the same variety or closely
allied to it, the White English Terrier, which, but for its
colour, being all pure white, is just built on the same
lines, and is suitable for the same purposes, as his black
and tan cousin. Some years since when the lighter
weights of bull terriers were more popular than at present,
I think they were largely crossed with White English,
so as to get down their size, and some I have had,
and many I have seen, have undoubtedly had some of
the Bull Terrier blood in them, which could be traced in
their skulls, showing rather more fullness than the
breed should indicate, and their dispositions being
rather more warlike than was always convenient to
their owners, or agreeable to their kennel companions.
I contend that a thoroughbred White English Terrier
is quite a superior dog and fit company for anyone. I
know some of the best at the present time are owned by
ladies.<span class="pagenum hide"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Poodles.</i>&mdash;One of the most intelligent breeds in existence,
that of the Poodle, lends itself especially to becoming
a pet or companion, soon becoming warmly
attached to its owner, very quick at learning what
is required of it, and very smart and vigilant as a
guard. Although, in ordinary life, we principally see
the curly variety, at all the leading shows, we see specimens
of the "corded variety" both white and black in
colour, and with coats quite fearful and wonderful to
behold, hanging in festoons of cords or tags, in some
cases of such length as to sweep the ground as they
walk along, which must be a considerable inconvenience
to the dogs, as well as their owners. There
has been much correspondence and discussion on the
subject, but I think, after a lengthened acquaintance
with the breed, and having seen and handled nearly all
the best specimens brought forward during the last
twenty-five years, there is no doubt there are two varieties,
corded and curly, and although they have been
sometimes interbred, there are corded specimens which
would be corded under any circumstances, and there are
curly ones that could not be turned into corded, how<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
ever long their coats were left alone. I speak from my
own experience, as I have had Poodles which were
never anything else but curly, whether clipped or unclipped,
and others with coats that would soon become
corded if not attended to. I know this is not a general
opinion, but it is my impression of the breed. It used
to be supposed there were only two colours for Poodles,
black and white, but of late years we have seen some
very beautiful specimens black and white, red, brown,
slate colour, and grey, and different shades of those
colours, and so many new breeders and exhibitors of
these dogs have appeared in this country and abroad,
that I think they may be said to be in more favour than
ever, and at most of the larger shows command large
entries and attract a great deal of attention from the
public, I am told. I had the record entry of eighty
specimens at the Ladies' KA Show at Ranelagh Park,
1896. Of course, any breed which requires exceptional
care in its preparation, and which so soon gives evidence
of any neglect (as in the case of an unshaven and
untrimmed Poodle), will always have a limited number
of active adherents, but irrespective of their value for
sporting purposes (in the same way as the English and
Irish Water Spaniels and the Retrievers), all who have
kept any of them will know they are full of merit, good
tempered as a rule, born humourists, fond of children,
grand swimmers, excellent guards, and very affectionate
and faithful to their owners and friends. A very
high authority, both as a breeder, exhibitor and
judge, has set out the points of a correct Poodle as follows:&mdash;head
long, straight and fine; skull rather nar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
<span class="pagenum hide"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span><span class="pagenum hide"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>

strong and fine jaw, not full in cheek; teeth white and
level; lips black and rather tight fitting; gums and
roof of mouth black; nose sharp and black; eyes very
dark brown, full of fire and intelligence, nearly almond
shaped, leather of ears long and wide, hanging close to
face; well proportioned neck of fair length and
strength; strong muscular shoulders, sloping well to
back; deep and moderately wide chest; short, strong,
slightly curved back; broad muscular loins; ribs well
sprung and braced up; small round feet, toes well
arched, pads thick and hard; well set, straight legs, with
plenty of bone and muscle; hind legs very muscular and
well bent, hocks well let down; tail not curled over back,
but carried rather gaily and set on high; coat profuse
and of good texture, not silky; if corded, hanging in
tight, even cords; if curled, in strong, thick curls, of
even length, without knots or cords. Colours should
be self, whites and blacks seem to be the most popular.
The general appearance is that of a very active, intelligent
and elegant looking dog, stepping out well and
carrying himself proudly.</p>

<p><i>Pomeranians.</i>&mdash;Another breed, which has made
gigantic strides in public favour of late years,
is the Pomeranian, which may be best described,
as a miniature copy of the Rough-coated Collie, as it
resembles it in nearly every respect, except the carriage
of ears and tail, the former being pricked and
carried bolt upright, and the latter curled over
the side and back of the body. The colours are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
very varied, starting with white, black, brown, blue,
almost every shade of those colours can be met with,
besides parti-colours, and the sizes run from nearly
thirty pounds to three pounds in weight. Other things
being equal, the smaller the size, the more valuable they
are, and high class specimens frequently change hands
at prices ranging from £10 to £200, so that it has lately
been one of the most profitable breeds to produce, as
good specimens have been commanding fair prices, and
plenty of buyers were found for anything out of the
common at almost any price. Browns have been
greatly in favour, latterly even more so than blacks, and
next to them come whites, but hitherto, there has been a
difficulty in obtaining very small whites, and if this is
overcome (and many of the leading breeders are doing
their best), I think the toy whites will be greatly
sought after; some of the little blacks and browns are
very beautiful, and I have known very long figures,
£100 and over, refused for them by their owners!
Being very lively, cheerful and affectionate, and exceedingly
sharp and active as guards, this breed is admirably
adapted as a pet or companion, and they make
very sharp house dogs. It is not desirable to chain them
up, as the rubbing of the collar and chain is almost certain
to interfere with the set of the crest and frill which
in this breed (as in Collies), form such attractive features
in their appearance. Pomeranians are seemingly
popular with all classes, from Royalty downward.
Her Majesty the Queen has a large kennel of them at
Windsor, which I had the honour of an invitation to inspect,
and can testify to the great interest taken in the<span class="pagenum hide"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span><span class="pagenum hide"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span><span class="pagenum hide"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span><span class="pagenum hide"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>breed, and the number of specimens kept, with every
care and consideration shown for their happiness and
comfort. Her Majesty's collection, when I saw them,
some time since, consisted almost entirely of what I
should call "off colours" that is, not white, black, brown
or blue, but shades and mixtures of those and other
colours, some exceedingly pretty, and although somewhat
larger in size, being mostly "small-medium," and
not so fine in head as many of the dogs now shown, are
so good in other respects, that they have often successfully
competed with well-known specimens, when Her
Majesty has entered any at the Royal Agricultural Hall
and Crystal Palace Shows. A great many are also kept
by persons in the higher, middle and lower ranks of life,
both in this country and the continent of Europe
(where, no doubt, the breed originated), and it is a
common occurrence, when a popular judge is officiating
at one of the larger shows, to see over fifty entries of
Pomeranians in the various classes. I have frequently
had one hundred, and sometimes even more entries to
judge, at the larger shows, and a puzzling job to undertake,
on a dull day, in a failing light, is to tackle a class
of from twenty to twenty-five black specimens, and try
to find out the respective merits of each when there are
probably ten or a dozen really good ones amongst the
lot, though, to an outsider, they all look much alike.
Small, good specimens fetch very long prices, and the
breed is exceedingly popular.</p>

<span class="caption">FAWN POMERANIAN CH. &quot;BRILLIANT&quot; J. DUCKWORTH OWNER.</span>
</div>
<p>The points are as follows: In general build, and
coat more especially, the Pomeranians should somewhat
resemble the Rough-coated Collie, with the difference
that his head should be shorter, ears smaller and carried
perfectly erect; and his tail curled up from the root
tightly over his back, or lying flat on his back. He
must be a compact little dog, well proportioned in build,
standing on straight limbs, and possessing a profuse
coat of long and perfectly straight silky or glossy hair
all over his body, forming a mane, round his neck, of
longer hair, with the forelegs feathered, and the thighs
more heavily feathered. He must be sharp and intelligent
in expression, and exhibit great activity and
buoyancy of disposition, and should not exceed twenty
pounds in weight, the smaller specimens being preferable.
At the larger shows they are generally divided
into over eight pounds and under eight pounds. Colours,
white, black, brown, blue and sable, and any combination
of those colours. At the present time there is
a feeling rather in favour of the shades of brown, but
there are many very beautiful specimens of all the colours
mentioned above.</p>

<p><i>Pugs.</i>&mdash;One of the really old-fashioned pets and companions
is the Pug, of which I have for the last thirty<span class="pagenum hide"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span><span class="pagenum hide"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>years generally had some specimens about my house,
and usually, when I have judged the breed, have been
favoured with record entries. I remember on one occasion,
when I had a very heavy day at an important
London show, and had taken an immense amount of
trouble, in the open, on a broiling day in June or July,
when the whole of my exhibitors were of the fair sex,
and ranged from the highest in the kennel-world, Her
Royal Highness, the Princess of Wales, to those
who would not be ashamed to be included amongst
"the working classes," I thought, "I shall catch
it pretty warmly over this job." I hardly supposed
it within the bounds of possibility for any living
"mere man," to give satisfaction to such a large number
of the other sex, especially when their own particular
pets were concerned, so that I was certainly
gratified to have a letter, some weeks after, from the
Hon. Secretary of the show (whose daughter was an
exhibitor and by no means a novice in Pugs either),
stating that I had "achieved the unique feat of pleasing
every one, as not a single complaint or grumble had
been heard or received by the committee from the large
body of Pug exhibitors." I mention this, not for
the purpose of self-glorification, but to show that, although
generally judges are supposed to meet with
obloquy and abuse, often not deserved, they do, sometimes,
receive kindly recognition of their endeavours,
to pick out the best specimens brought under their notice!
A good Pug should have a large skull, in proportion
to size, well-defined stop, with high forehead,
square face, wide-apart eyes, dark and large, round<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
and rather prominent; thin, small ears, carried well forward,
a desideratum is a black thumb mark in middle of
skull, the mask and ears should be black. Heavy
wrinkles about head and face; muscular, thick neck,
with skin loose; square, thick, cobby body; deep loins;
well rounded ribs; dark trace down back very desirable;
also a dark mole on each cheek; muscular hindquarters;
firm thighs; strong, short, straight fore
legs; well arched, firm, round feet, with black toe
nails if possible; tail tightly curled on hips, double
turn much desired; coat, except on tail, where it
is longer and harsher, should be glossy, soft and
short. A very smart, showy and active dog, <i>often an
arrant coward</i>, but with a great appearance of dignity,
and even ferocity, which is not without its impression
on the public. My experience of the breed is that they
are, as a rule, very affectionate, and devoted to their
owners, "good-doers" and nearly always ready for
anything in the way of eating and drinking, great
lovers of comfort, and very jealous of any
other members of the doggy community being
made as much of as themselves. They are very
lively, bustling companions, and very popular with
those who have kept them. I omitted to say,
that the colours are silver fawn and apricot fawn,
and of late years, there is also a black variety, the points
of which are really the same as in the fawns, but partly
concealed by the colour. I think, as a rule, the blacks
run more leggy, and many of them heavier than the
fawns, but I have had some beautiful specimens of both
colours before me many times, and I like a good one,<span class="pagenum hide"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span><span class="pagenum hide"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>

in a small one, it is all the better.</p>

<p>Two of the best-known illustrate this variety.</p>

<span class="caption">SCHIPPERCHE CH. &quot;ZWARTE PIOT&quot; I. N. WOODIWISS OWNER.</span>
</div>
<p><i>Schipperkes.</i>&mdash;The Schipperke is rather a new breed
in this country, and much kept as a pet and companion
by its supporters. It was, I think, imported originally
from Belgium, where, I understand, though I do
not remember seeing many there, it has long been used
by the Bargees as a protection on board their boats for
their persons and property on their long journeys
through the canals. In appearance it is something like
a medium or rather small-sized black Pomeranian,
out of coat and without any tail, the texture of the coat
dense and harsh, soft on the ears, smooth on the head,
front of hocks and forelegs, but forming a mane
or frill, round neck and shoulders; size should not
exceed twenty pounds, and all the better if it is
less; eyes small, slightly oval, and dark brown in
colour; they make very sharp little watch dogs,
are always on the move, and anxious to know the
ins and outs of what comes in their way, very
excitable and lively in temperament, the former being
expressed by raising their mane referred to, barking
sharply and running and jumping about; they are
good and game vermin killers, as a general rule.<span class="pagenum hide"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span></p>

</div>
<p><span class="smcap">I now</span> come to another group of undoubted pets
and companions, I mean the Toy Spaniels, and a
charming lot they are. I will briefly notice them in their
usually accepted order, taking our old friend, the King
Charles, first. I am afraid I shall be thought "laudator
temporis acti," and old-fashioned, but hardened "all-round
dog lover" as I am, and have been, ever since I
knew one end of a dog from another, I must say, I
dearly love a good "King Charles," and, as I always go
through the classes for them, at all the big shows, even
when I have nothing, judicially, to do with them, I am
grieved to see such small entries of these beautiful dogs,
and so few good enough to "fill the eye" of a critical
fancier. It is not so much of the size, or colours I complain,
as the coats, which are so, very often, curly, a bad
fault, in my opinion, and many of them are "smutty"
and dark in their tan. Of course there are notable exceptions,
but I greatly fear that other dog breeds,
which have been warmly "pushed" of late years, in
every possible way, and, generally, by interested parties,
have disheartened the breeders of some of the Toy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
Spaniels, or, we should see more good ones coming out!
The points of the breed to be desired are large round
skull, with well defined "stop," large, lustrous eyes,
short, turned-up muzzle, long pendulous ears, well-feathered;
fairly long neck, short and compact back,
short straight fore-legs, feet large, soft, profuse coat,
quite straight, without tendency to curl, colour glossy,
unbroken black, and rich mahogany tan. Weight not to
exceed twelve pounds, as much less as possible, with
quality.</p>

<span class="caption">BLENHEIM SPANIEL. CH. &quot;ROLLO&quot; MRS. FORDER, OWNER.</span>
</div>
<p><i>The Blenheim Spaniel.</i>&mdash;The next of this charming
group to be considered, is the Blenheim Spaniel, with
which, its having been the favourite breed of my dear
mother, and her mother, I have been more associated
than with some of the others; the points of a perfect
specimen are almost entirely the same as in the King
Charles, except that the colours are red and white, with
more of the latter than the former, and it is very desirable
to have a distinct mark of red about the size of a
shilling or florin, on the upper part of the skull, which
is termed "the spot" and is a recognised peculiarity of
this variety.</p>

<span class="caption">PRINCE CHARLES SPANIEL CH. &quot;VICTOR WILD&quot; H. TAYLOR OWNER.</span>
</div>
<p><i>The Prince Charles Spaniel.</i>&mdash;Another variety is
known as the Prince Charles, and the points of
this again are the same as of the King Charles,
except in colour, which is white with a good deal of
black and tan markings. When evenly marked, and well
formed in other ways, they are very attractive little fellows.
I have noticed a tendency, particularly with these,<span class="pagenum hide"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span><span class="pagenum hide"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>

be under the maximum weight allowed (twelve
pounds) as the intention is, they should be not too
heavy for a lady to pick up, and carry her little companion,
when out with it, if so disposed. So that, from
six to ten pounds would be a more suitable weight, and
such as you may see in numbers of Yorkshire Terriers,
Griffons, Pomeranians and Japanese Spaniels, some of
the keenest rivals of the native Toy Spaniels. In
fact many of all those varieties can be obtained
well under five pounds weight, or even less if desired.</p>

<span class="caption">RUBY SPANIEL. CH. &quot;JASPER&quot; MRS. WOODGATE OWNER.</span>
</div>

<p><i>The Ruby Toy Spaniel.</i>&mdash;Another very beautiful
variety, is the Ruby Spaniel, something the colour
of its larger cousin, the Sussex Spaniel, but
richer, and brighter in tone. I am afraid these
are not being so much bred as they were some
years since, but all true dog lovers, would regret
their becoming extinct, on account of their great beauty
and aristocratic appearance; to be correct, the colour
should be quite free from white, as rich and bright as
possible, and the points same as King Charles and without
legginess, which seems to affect these more than the
other varieties; I suppose, there is little doubt the native
breeds of Toy Spaniels have been much interbred, and
I have been told by breeders they have had in one litter
a specimen of all four breeds. I cannot vouch for the
truth of this, as it has not happened within my own experience,
but if true, it confirms the idea of how much
they have been interbred.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span></p>

<span class="caption">JAPANESE SPANIEL CH. &quot;DAI BUTZU&quot; MRS. ADDIS OWNER.</span>
</div>

<p><i>The Japanese Spaniel.</i>&mdash;The last of the Toy Spaniel
family to be noticed is the Japanese Spaniel, and, at the
present time, I think, it enjoys the most popularity, and
is kept by ladies of high rank, as well as by their humbler
fellow-creatures. In point of colour, they most resemble
the Prince Charlies, and they are sometimes,
but not often, seen almost the colours of a Blenheim.
They are not so high, or domed in skull, but much wider,
both in head and face, with very short nose, fairly large,
pendulous ears, large, dark, full eyes, rather short on
legs, cobby in body, and with tail curled over back,
something in the way of the Maltese Terrier. They have
a very quaint, old-fashioned look about them, even
when puppies, and, unless they have been bred in this
country, or, until they get acclimatized, are certainly
delicate, and the mortality amongst the imported specimens
has been very great. It is now sometime since I
had any of the breed, and, at that time, larger specimens
were in vogue than now appear at our shows; but no
doubt, as ladies' pets, they are better, not exceeding
eight or nine pounds. I may mention, to prove how
these pretty little creatures have come forward of late
years, I was present at a large London show, where a
Japanese Spaniel, belonging to a friend of mine, a well-known
lady-exhibitor, was awarded the first prize (a
seventy-guinea silver cup in which the winner might
have been hidden!) as the "Champion of champions,"
in a class composed of all the specimens of all kinds of
dogs, that had been awarded a championship at that
show, and the gratified owner had the honour of receiving
the splendid prize from H. R. H. the Princess of<span class="pagenum hide"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span><span class="pagenum hide">

<p><span class="smcap">To</span> take these in the above order, I propose
to say a few words about each. I regret to say
that, really first-rate specimens of the Toy Black and
Tans are few and far between, there are many of the
right size, and colour, but, so many fail in head, which
should be like that of a true terrier of the "Manchester"
type, in miniature, but the majority are too round and
short in skull, and the other "points" of the breeds are
the same. I need not say that a good specimen is a beautiful
little creature and a charming pet for a lady, and
very smart and showy. I have little doubt that the edict
against cropping has had a prejudicial effect on them,
as well as their larger brethren, and that having to wear
such ears, as they have been born with, gives no chance
for the skill of the "cropper" to improve their appearance,
and, a great many of the breed appear to have
what are known as "Bat," or "Tulip," ears, which look
out of proportion to their size. I am in hopes that
breeders may succeed (as has been done with the
"Manchesters") in breeding more specimens with
small drop ears, of the orthodox type, when, no doubt,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
a revival of interest will be taken in this somewhat
neglected variety. One of the best seen for years illustrates
this variety. Occasionally more or less good
specimens of the White English Smooth Terrier, in
miniature, are seen, and when correct in points, they
are very pretty.</p>

<p><i>Yorkshire Toy Terrier.</i>&mdash;I will now speak of
another very beautiful breed of dogs, well suited
as ladies' pets. Yorkshire Terriers, sometimes not
exceeding three pounds in weight, colour slate blue
on back and sides, also part of head, the rest a
golden tan; when in form, the coat sweeps the
ground, and is soft and bright in texture, and colour;
of course, such a breed cannot be kept "up to the
mark" without some care, and trouble, but a good
specimen, turned out in correct form, is "quite a
picture," and provokes any amount of admiration particularly
amongst the fair sex, and I have known any
sum from £5 to £250 to be paid for really tip-toppers,
to be kept as companions, for which they are well
suited, and I can, from my own experience, testify to
their affectionate and engaging qualities. Of course
their coats must be kept to a reasonable length, often
brushed out, and they would not be suitable inmates
for a kennel, being essentially a breed for indoors.</p>

<p>The best specimen living illustrates this variety.</p>

<p><i>Maltese Terriers.</i>&mdash;Another of the Pet Dogs, proper,
is the lovely little Maltese Terrier, whose praises I have
been singing for years, and I am delighted to see they<span class="pagenum hide"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span><span class="pagenum hide"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>

who remember the Team shown, many years since,
by the late Lady Giffard, will, I think, confirm my opinion,
that a more beautiful lot of ladies' pet dogs could
not be seen. To those not acquainted with the breed, I
may say, they resemble very small drop-eared Skye
Terriers, with pure white long coats, often sweeping
the ground, and almost like floss silk in texture, with
short backs and tails curled over them, dark, piercing
eyes and black noses. They are very smart, corky little
fellows. I admire them greatly, and have done my
best for some years past to revive interest in them, and
am glad to see better entries at shows which provide
classes and judges to suit them. This is thought to be
one of the oldest of the Toy breeds, having been highly
prized by the ladies of ancient Greece, and other nations
of that historic period. Head should be much like that
of a drop-eared Skye in miniature. Coat long, straight
and silky, often sweeping the ground, quite free from
curl, or wooliness. Nose and roof of mouth black, ears
moderately long, well feathered, with hair mingling on
neck. Tail short, well feathered, and curled tightly over
back. Colour, pure white, without markings, or even
tints of any other colour. Weight five to six pounds,
the smaller the better, other points being equal.</p>

<p>By the kindness of my old friend, Mr. J. Jacobs, the
best known breeder of Maltese, I have been able to give
a portrait of his beautiful little champion.</p>

<p><i>Griffons Bruxelles.</i>&mdash;One of the most recent of all
the breeds suitable as pets and companions and which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
has been very much "boomed" the last few years, is
the above named, somewhere about the size, and
a little the shape of a Yorkshire Toy Terrier, if you
can imagine one with a short harsh coat instead of a
long silky one, and with a chin prominent as possible,
without showing the teeth, in fact, "under-jawed;"
round nearly black eyes; lashes, and lids dark, short
black nose, with hair around it and the eyes; prick ears
carried straight up as darts, feet longish; tail docked
rather short; head round and covered with harsh hair,
not woolly or silky; longer round eyes, nose, lips
(which should have a "moustache" over them,) and
cheeks; colour preferred, chestnut red, wiry rough,
and plentiful coat, but not long. Weight for the larger
variety nine pounds maximum; for the smaller five
pounds maximum. These are cobby in build, active, intelligent,
hardy little fellows, very quaint, comical, and
self-important in their ways, which makes them attractive,
even to persons not taking much interest in
dogs in general; they are now being pushed forward
very much and have a club of their own, so they seem
likely to, what is called "catch on!"</p>

<p>I have secured the portrait of a grand little specimen

<p><i>Toy Bull Dogs.</i>&mdash;Have been much taken up of late,
and strange though it may seem, for an offshoot, or
miniature variety of an old English breed, the larger
number of the best that have appeared at the shows, so
far, have come from France! I have seen many specimens
with good heads and bodies, but comparatively
few with the correct type of ear, the majority having
what I described in speaking of Smooth Toy Terriers,
as "Bat or Tulip" ears, which give rather a silly, vacant,
expression to the face. However, the breed is
being so eagerly patronised by people in the higher
ranks, and good specimens easily command such high
prices, that there is little reason to doubt, breeders will
succeed in producing more specimens, with the correct
type of ear, when we shall see a great improvement in
the number and quality of the entries at all those shows
which provide classes for these quaint little animals,
which should be kept down to a twenty-pound limit at
most, if they are to retain their title to be classified
amongst the "Toys."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Toy Bull Terriers.</i>&mdash;The Toy Bull Terriers which
have been a good deal encouraged of late years, should
be counterparts of the larger breed, but too many of
them fail in head properties, and are both too short in
face and too round in skull, very often, they have a
small patch of brindle or other colour on some part of
their head or body, although they are preferred pure
white, if possible. For many years I kept some of these,
and bred them as small as two and a half pounds, but
even at that weight their courage did not seem less, and
the smallest I ever had was killed by her reckless attack
on an antagonist far beyond her powers. I have
known several others without the slightest consideration
of their size and weight, rush upon foes that could
actually have swallowed them, without the least hesitation,
or any show of fear.</p>

<p><i>Italian Greyhounds.</i>&mdash;Another very graceful and elegant
breed is the Italian Greyhound, which some years
ago was much more kept as a pet than of late; it is more
slightly built and shorter in head than the Whippet,
and the colours most often seen are golden fawns and
creams, but I have had some before me, and well
shaped ones too, red, red and white, and blue fawn, the
last named being the best of the "off colours." The
coat should be very fine, soft and glossy, the best size is
not exceeding eight or eight and a half pounds, in
weight. They are exceedingly graceful, elegant little
creatures, but rightly or wrongly (as this is one of the
few breeds of dogs, I have not bred or kept,) give me
the impression of being delicate and requiring care and<span class="pagenum hide"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>

<span class="pagenum hide"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>attention. The breed seems mostly in the hands of three
or four persons, but I am pleased to say, there are still
some excellent specimens of both sexes to be seen, so
that I am in hopes there is no immediate fear of its extinction,
as this is one of the breeds that would not look
out of place in company with the highest in the land.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Something About Foreign Dogs</span></p>

<p>
<span class="smcap">I think,</span> perhaps, it will be best for me to say something
about these, although my friend, Mr. Edwin
Brough, was wont to call them by the generic term of
"Wild Beasts," particularly those belonging to our
mutual friend, Mr. W. K. Taunton, who for very
many years had one of the best collections of rare
breeds of foreign dogs, I should say, to be met with in
Europe, comprising specimens from the Arctic Regions,
China, Australia, India, Africa and other distant
parts of the world. I have often had specimens of
his before me at different shows, particularly those held
in the London District, and remember paying a visit, by
invitation, some years since to his kennels in Essex and
being very much interested in the many typical specimens
I saw there. I should consider Mr. Taunton
not only a first-rate judge of bloodhounds and mastiffs,
but (although one of the most unassuming men I
know) far and away, the ablest and best judge of
"Foreign Dogs" in this country, or probably in any
other. He has bred and owned more than most other
judges have even seen!</p>

<p><i>The Norwegian Elk-Hound.</i>&mdash;One of the kinds most
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>often kept is the Norwegian Elk-Hound, which much
resembles the Esquimaux, but differs in character of
coat, ears and tail. He should be active in build, though
strongly made, particularly in the shoulders; fairly
long wedge-shaped head; rather strong and blunt
shaped jaws; thick coat, with plenty of undercoat, in
varying shades of dark and light grey, back parts being
darker and under parts lighter and sometimes slightly
tanned; good round feet, with legs strong, firm and
straight, ears much larger and differently carried from
the Esquimaux, both upright and pointed; tail profusely
covered with hair, and carried with a double
twist to the side, rather inclined to be wolf-like in expression,
with dark brown eyes.</p>

<p><i>The Persian Greyhound</i> is another of the "Foreigners"
sometimes met with, and is a very elegant creature
if shown in good form, about the size of a medium-sized
greyhound, with soft feathery fringe on
head and ears, thighs, tail and elsewhere, which
gives a very unique appearance to it, the colours
most often seen are shades of fawn, or drab, and from
the extra hair upon it they seem to be shorter and
stronger in head than the British greyhounds. There
is a variety called the Afghan Greyhounds, which
greatly resemble the Persians even in colours,
except that all the specimens I have had before
me of the latter have been considerably less,
more like large Whippets in size. I am not prepared
to say whether there is any, or if so what, connection
<span class="pagenum hide"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span><span class="pagenum hide"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>between the two breeds.
<span class="pagenum hide"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span><span class="pagenum hide"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span></p>

<p><i>The African Sand Dog</i> is another breed occasionally
seen; it is remarkable for being almost entirely without
hair, usually a sort of blue black in colour, and sometimes
having a tuft of coarse bristle-like hair on the top
of the head, and a similar tuft of the same colour and
character at the end of the tail. In shape and appearance
they slightly resemble a fat, and rather coarse,
both in head and body, black and tan terrier; they, no
doubt, have their admirers, or they would not continue
to be imported and kept, but they are essentially one of
the breeds that may be described as "not everybody's
money."</p>

<span class="caption">THIBET SHEEP DOG &quot;SIRING&quot; H. R. H. PRINCE of WALES OWNER.</span>
</div>

<p><i>Thibet Sheep Dogs.</i>&mdash;A breed I have not often seen,
but which is really a handsome and noble looking
one is the Great Thibet Sheep Dog, of which I
remember H. R. H. the Prince of Wales had
a good specimen at Sandringham some years since,
which I can only describe as having a Collie-like
body with a thick under and over coat,
but not so profuse as with our collies, and a head
combining the expression of Newfoundland, Mastiff
and Bloodhound, large, pendulous ears, heavy lips and
jaws, and great dignity, and even ferocity in appearance.
From the rough life they live, with very
rough people, I have heard from those who have travelled
in Thibet, these dogs are very awkward customers
to tackle, and often make things very unpleasant
for travellers and strangers, but I have no doubt they
would make excellent guards, and have a very distinguished
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span>appearance as companions.</p>


<p><i>Afghan Sheep Dog.</i>&mdash;Another eastern breed is the
Afghan Sheep Dog, which, in the specimens I have
seen greatly resembles our own breed of English Short-tailed
Sheep Dog, and like him, is covered all over with
a dense, shaggy coat. It seemed to me, they were somewhat
more woolly in texture and corded in character
than the coats of our dogs, and also they were leggier
and more tucked up, so that, although they stand as
high, or higher, I should say they would weigh considerably
less on the average than our own "Bobtails."
Their colours appear to be usually white, with brown
or black markings, more or less profusely scattered
over the bodies.</p>

<span class="caption">ESQUIMAUX CH. &quot;ARCTIC KING&quot; M<sup>rs</sup> H. C. BROOKE OWNER.</span>
</div>

<p><i>Esquimaux.</i>&mdash;The Esquimaux is another of the foreign
breeds occasionally seen here, rather larger
and heavier than the Chow, and longer in head
and neck, generally some shade of grey or black
and white in colour with a harsh outer, but dense
warm under coat, rather long and arched in neck,
eyes obliquely set, small for size of dog, and
very sly and wolf-like in expression, with pricked
ears carried rather forward and tail curled over back.
In the general way, they are not very fascinating to
strangers, and may be spoken of in the same terms as
the hero of a popular comic song who was said to be
"all right, when you know him, but you've got to know
him, <i>first</i>!" No doubt, the number of expeditions to
the Arctic regions of late years, and the keen public interest
taken in all their details, has had the effect of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span><span class="pagenum hide">

bringing these dogs, so important to all Arctic explorers, more to the front. There is a quaint, independent air
about them I rather like. I have very frequently had
to judge them in classes of "foreign dogs from the
Arctic and Northern regions," and should not describe
them as very genial, or sociable, in manner, although
somewhat unique and interesting in appearance.</p>

<span class="caption">CHOW CHOW. CH. &quot;CHOW VIII&quot;. M<sup>rs</sup> FABER OWNER.</span>
</div>

<p><i>Chow.</i>&mdash;Another breed which is not without its
supporters, many of whom are amongst the ranks
of the aristocracy, is the Chow, which, as the
name implies, is a native of China, and much
resembles a large, coarse Pomeranian, with a
short thick head and rather blunt prick ears,
the colours are almost invariably shades of red,
black, or slate blue, though I have seen some variations
on these. Chows often are as large as small collies,
and possess very warm dense coats, somewhat in
the Esquimaux style, and carry their tails much the
same way, and are remarkable for having nearly
inky black tongues. Like many of these foreign
breeds, they are hardly yet naturalised in this country,
but they are handsome, distinguished-looking dogs and
not unlikely to become more popular, as they become
more understood. At present they are in very few
hands, and are more often met with at shows in the
"any other variety" or "Foreign, any variety,"
classes, than in a class or classes to themselves,
but at some of the larger shows, I have frequently had
good entries of them, containing many beautiful specimens
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span>of the breed.</p>

<p class="center">SHOW POINTS OF CHOWS</p>

<p>The points of Chows are as follows: Skull flat and
wide, muzzle substantial under the eyes, of fair length
and rather blunt at the nose, tongue and lips black, eyes
dark and small, ears very small, pointed, carried erect
and forward; neck powerful and slightly arched, shoulders
muscular and nicely sloped, chest wide and deep,
body short and powerful with strong loins; fore-legs
strong and straight with small round feet, hindquarters
rather square with hindquarters well let down, tail
tightly curled over back, coat very profuse, flat and
rather coarse in texture. Colours most usually black or
red; yellow, blue and white, if strictly self colours, are
correct. Weight, dogs forty to fifty pounds; bitches a
little less.</p>

</div>

<p><i>The Dingo.</i>&mdash;Another colonial breed, the Dingo or
Wild Dog of Australia, many of us have heard of but
few seen. As I happen to have a brother, a clergyman,
in that country, whose parish is forty miles square, taking
him the best part of each week to visit his parishioners
on horseback or in buggy, also three nephews,
sons of another brother, likewise a clergyman in England,
all situated in different parts of the same colony,
I have heard a great deal of the doings of the "Dingoes."
They are very particular in their attentions to
the poultry, lambs, and sometimes sheep, so that they
do not bear a good name in that country! They are a
<span class="pagenum hide"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span><span class="pagenum hide"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span>good deal like jackals, but rather larger in size, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span>coats sleeker, and tails less feathered, less mane on
shoulders, and perhaps somewhat finer in head, quite a
sly, wolf-like expression, not often very safe to handle;
colours usually shades of yellow, or sandy, but I have
seen them shades of brown, and grey mixed, rather fox-like
in bark; they are usually kept as curiosities of the
canine race, frequently muzzled or "caged," but as they
get more used to civilised life, they may develop more
interesting qualities than they have yet been credited
with.</p>

<p><i>The Chinese Crested Dog.</i>&mdash;I think I will bring this
brief notice of some of the "outlandish" breeds
to a close, with a mention of what I think is
rather a rare sort, the Chinese Crested Dog, as, although
I have judged Foreign Dogs at all the leading
shows during a great many years, I have had very few
true specimens of this scarce breed brought before me.
I am pleased to have been able to secure a good portrait
of the best I have ever seen, by the courtesy of its owner.
I have generally found them with a smooth mottled
skin quite devoid of hair, except a crest, or tuft of
stiffish hair on the forehead or above it, usually nearly
white or whitey brown in colour, and a tuft
of similar colour and character at the end of
the tail. Round skull, well defined "stop," and
rather short, mean face, in shape and style
of body something like a coarse strong Italian
greyhound, and nearly always giving you the idea of
being pinched with the cold. From what little I have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span>seen of them, I should consider them, rather delicate,
and unsuited for our climate, except under favourable
circumstances. I imagine they are merely kept as companions
and pets, as I never heard of any of them being
turned to account for any useful purpose. I am aware
there are several other breeds I might have included in
this chapter, such as the Samoyede Sledge dogs, (a
capital portrait of this breed is here given) the
Pyrennean Sheep Dog; the Leonberg Dog, <i>The
Dogue de Bordeaux</i>, a capital portrait of a very fine
specimen of which is also given, and which has a
great deal the character of a high-class Bull Mastiff
about it, and has been largely used on the Continent in
fighting the bear and other large game; and others,
but I think I have said enough to comply with its

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Humours and Vagaries of the Show-Rings</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">I remember</span> meeting a friend, many years since,
whose wife was rather a fine woman, who had <i>been</i>
younger and better looking, but still "fancied herself"
a good deal, and had a decent Pug, which she made a
point of taking to any shows held in their neighbourhood,
and as I knew he had entered the Pug in two or
three classes at a local show where a reverend gentleman,
at that time very well known as an "all round
judge," at many shows throughout the kingdom, was
officiating, I said, "Well, old fellow, and how did your
wife get on with her Pug?" "Oh, very badly," said
he, "there was a smart looking girl, with pink roses in
her hat, had a dog in the ring, and the judge couldn't
look at anything else, although our Pug was ever so
much better!"</p>

<p>As I happened to hear, casually, that another reverend
judge, who had been not only a very successful
breeder and exhibitor, but one of our ablest judges,
particularly of the non-sporting breeds, was about
to decline further judging, I considered, especially
at that time, when there were few judges of ability
and standing, that he could be ill spared, so I wrote to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span>ask him, if I obtained a strong expression of opinion
from some of the leading exhibitors in his section,
whether he would reconsider the matter, and he wrote
me a very courteous letter, agreeing to do so. I then
had a fac-simile letter, of my writing, prepared, and
sent a copy to all the leading breeders and exhibitors of
non-sporting dogs, and I do not think I had one refusal.
I doubt if any judge ever had such a requisition, and the
result was, that for many years, the public had the benefit
of his valuable services, until, I regret to say, ill
health compelled him to give up all such matters, but he
retained his popularity to the last, and his retirement
was universally regretted. I have often met him since
as a looker on at shows, and we have occasionally corresponded.</p>

<p>As I have mentioned in the earlier pages of this
work, for many years I was a very keen breeder and
exhibitor of Dandies, and kept a great many of them
at one time, perhaps the strongest kennel of the
breed in the kingdom, and won scores of prizes, etc. I
remember, on one occasion, when I had a team of dogs
at a show in Gloucestershire, I had one of my best
Dandies entered either in a "Rough Terrier Class,"
or a class composed of "Winners of so many Prizes"
(in those days, all sorts of peculiar classes and conditions
were introduced into the schedules), and there<br />
were two judges to officiate, neither of whom, I very
much expect, had ever had a Dandie before him previously.
I was, at first, much amused to see how they
were puzzled over him, and I could see them taking
counsel together (I may say, they were men of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span>highest class, as straight as gun barrels, and both deservedly respected and esteemed by the whole kennel
world, one amongst sporting, the other among non-sporting
classes, but as I hope and believe they are both
still living I will not mention their names, although I
have told the tale to one of them to his intense amusement
and delight). But afterwards, I began to fear
they would, from not being sure what manner of animal
I had in tow, pass me over, or worse still, give some
inferior notice to my dog, who was a noted champion,
and about the best specimen of the breed <i>at that time</i>.
After a while they came back to me and made a more
detailed examination of my dog, asked me his number,
and awarded him First Prize and Special, to my great
relief, as I had been thinking what a fool I had been to
enter a "Champion," to have such a chance of a
"knock-back" at a county show!</p>

<p>Sometime after that, I was taking a short exhibiting
tour, with a team of my dogs, following three or four
shows, held close together, and not more than one or
two days each in duration. Amongst others I had an
excellent Dandie Bitch with me, who had never been
"out of the money," and was in excellent form at the
time. I showed her at one place (Reading, I fancy,)
and took first under the Rev. W. I. Mellor. The next
show was, I think, Swindon; there I met almost the
same lot of Dandies, this time under the late Mr. W.
Lort, who, after he had looked through the class, came
up to me and said, "I am sorry to say, Mr. Lane, I cannot
give you more than 'Very Highly Commended,'
for your Bitch." I replied, "In that case, sir, I shall be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span>greatly obliged by your passing her over altogether; she
took first prize yesterday in the same company under
Mr. Mellor, who is reckoned one of our leading Dandie
judges, and I am going to show her under him to-morrow
at Henley (I think it was) where I have every
hope she will <i>do the same</i>, so that I should not like her
to take 'V. H. C.' <i>for the first time in her life</i> in between."
So the bitch was passed over and duly won
another first prize the next day.</p>

<p>The first time I had the honor of judging any dogs
belonging to members of the Royal Family was many
years since at Warwick, where, I believe, H. R. H. the
Prince of Wales exhibited, for the first time, Skyes,
and foreign dogs. He may have shown others, also, but
those were the classes with which I was concerned. I
remember the Committee and Chairman of the show
were, quite properly, much impressed with the honour
of the Royal patronage to their show at that time,
nearly or quite the best held out of London and admirably
managed by a well organised and most capable and
courteous committee of "real workers," whom it was
always a pleasure to meet. As I judged, or showed, at
all their shows, I can speak from experience; and I may
further say that I consider it a <i>positive calamity</i> for the
kennel world when these shows came to an end. For,
not only were they most delightful gatherings, of the
"Flower of the Fancy," both dogs, and people, but,
held in well adapted buildings and premises, near the
quaint old Midland Town, almost under the shadow
of the historic castle and under the active patronage
of the late Earl of Warwick, and the present Earl,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span>then Lord Brooke (both able and devoted "Dog
Fanciers") and his beautiful wife, who always used
to grace the shows by her presence, and took a keen
interest in many of the animals shown, besides being
an exhibitor in some of the classes. The Chairman
intimated to me that the inmates of the Royal
Kennel should stand well in the Prize List. I told
him "every dog entered would be judged by me strictly
on its merits, and if it was afterwards found the
Royal Dogs were amongst the Prize Winners, none
would be more pleased than I should, but I could not
say or do more than that, and I was sure H. R. H.
would wish his dogs to stand, or fall, on their merits
alone!" Since then I have very often had the honour
of judging dogs from the Royal Kennels, both Sandringham
and Windsor.</p>

<p>I remember it so happened that the first time Her
Majesty the Queen exhibited any dogs, nearly all Her
Majesty's entries came into my classes at a Great
London show. Soon after my entering the building
I went to have a look at my classes, and
shortly afterwards, the secretary came up to me
and said, "Do you know you have the great honour
of being the first man to judge any dogs from
Her Majesty's kennels?" I said, "I have heard
so." He then said, "Well, I am most anxious
they should all be in the prize list, as I consider it a
high honour that Her Majesty has allowed them to be
entered." I said, "That is all right enough, but although
I will not admit Her Majesty has a more loyal
or devoted subject than myself, I am here in a public
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span>capacity as a judge, and if Her Majesty's dogs are entered, in competition with Her Majesty's subjects'
dogs, they can only be judged 'on their merits,'
and from what I can see on the benches as the
Royal dogs have been pointed out to me by your
keepers I don't think many of them will be 'in
the money,' as the classes are very large and
good." He said, "That will never do; what can
be done?" I said, "Will you leave it to me?"
He said, "Yes, entirely." I said, "Then I will have all
the dogs of the same colour and type as those from the
Royal kennels, formed into a separate class," (which
luckily, was feasible,) "and judged together." This
was done and I hope caused general satisfaction, which
would not have been the case had any partiality been
shown, nor would such have been approved by Her
Majesty, I am perfectly sure, if the circumstances came
to be known at the palace.</p>

<p>On one occasion when I had been judging a
number of classes at a large London show, after
I had done, one of the fair exhibitors came up to
me and said, "You don't seem to like my dogs."
I said, "If you will tell me the numbers of your dogs
I will refer to my judging book, and see what notes I
made of them." She gave the numbers, and I read out
the notes on each. But this did not satisfy her, and she
said, "Ah! I am only a poor widow, if I were only a
rich heiress, like &mdash;&mdash;, I suppose it would be different,
she can win any number of prizes with her dogs." I replied,
"You have no right to speak in that way to me,
neither you nor any other exhibitor can say I have ever
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span>made any distinction between rich and poor. I have always sought to judge the dogs alone, irrespective of
their owners; if the dogs of the person you mention
have won it is because they were, in my opinion, the
best." She said no more, nor did I, but I presume she
thought I spoke the truth, as I have often noticed her as
an exhibitor in my classes, at various shows since, and
it is not reasonable to suppose she would continue to
show under me, if she thought I favoured any one!</p>

<p>Indeed, there are so many "lookers-on" round every
ring, nowadays who understand the various breeds, and
are prepared to criticise the awards, that judges are
"put upon their mettle," particularly with some of the
popular breeds, where the competition is often very
keen, and the entries large.</p>

<p>Some years since, at a large show in Wales I had
a large and good class of Bedlington Terriers, but
there was one dog that stood out, head and shoulders
above the rest; it chanced that I began my examination
of each specimen in the class, which I
always endeavour to make, and a short note of the result
in my book, at the dog standing next to him in the
ring, and therefore he was the last to be looked at, and
merely going over him enough to see that his coat, condition,
topknot, legs, eyes, teeth and ears, were satisfactory,
I sent them for a run round, marked my book and
dismissed the class; while I was waiting for the next
lot of dogs a very melancholy-looking man crept up to
me and said, "Would you kindly tell me, sir, what you
gave my dog?" I asked his number, and when he told
me, said, "First and special for best in the show;" he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span>threw his hat up in the air, and roared out, "Well, I'm
blessed, I knowed he knowed 'em, he didn't hardly want
to look at my dog, he didn't, he could see he were
the best with half an eye, he could," and, from being a
solemn and sad-looking person, he became the most
jovial-looking fellow you could wish to see. I did not
know his name, and do not know it now, but he amused
me very much at the time!</p>

<p>I do not remember <i>where</i> it occurred, but I was
judging rather a good class of Scottish Terriers
somewhere in the provinces, and a keeper brought
in a dog I liked the look of, and after going over
the classes I marked him first, and told the keeper
to take him away and bench him, which I suppose
he did. You can imagine my surprise when
shortly after, the same dog made his appearance in the
ring again, this time led by a man I knew well as rather
an extensive exhibitor, at that time, and he began
"making the most of his dog" before me. But as I
had quite done with him, and had still some of my
awards in the class to make, I did not want that, so I
said, "I should take away that dog, and bench him if
I were you, as he has been judged and sent out sometime
since." The exhibitor in question, whom his worst
enemy would not describe as either shy or timid, was
unusually rapid in his departure from that ring, and I
have since heard the story from others, to whom I suppose
he told it, but I have never told it until now!</p>

<p>I have had such a long and varied experience of judging,
that although I have often and often had classes
large enough and strong enough to make one "pull
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span>one's self together," I never remember being really
"nonplussed," but <i>once</i>, and that was when I was
judging some years ago at the People's Palace, situated
in the East End of London. I presume, the "drawers
up" of the schedule had not been previously experienced
in such work, as amongst others, they had provided
a "Variety Class for London Exhibitors," and, if
obtaining entries is a criterion of success, it was very
successful, as they obtained no less than 145 entries. I
do not know, but I should think, it was the largest class
ever seen at any show! And when I saw the tens and
scores of dogs pouring into my ring, I wondered what
was to become of them, as it was a good walk merely to
go round them, and they formed a small dog show by
themselves, and I noticed about five or six well-known
"Champions" amongst them, as it included most of
the known breeds of dogs. After referring to my judging
book, many pages in which were of course taken up,
I found I had three prizes to divide amongst this crowd,
so I went to the committee, and explained the matter to
them. They behaved very well indeed, they said, "We
will leave the matter entirely to you, do whatever you
please in it." I went back, divided the class into over
thirty pounds and under thirty pounds, cleared out all
that was no good, and weeded down the remainder, and
eventually gave two equal firsts, two equal seconds, and
two equal thirds in each division, making twelve prizes
and two "reserves" in all, which was a lot better than
attempting to award three prizes amongst close on 150
dogs. I think the exhibitors were pleased, and felt I
had done the best in my power to get them and myself
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span>out of an awkward position.</p>

<p>Many of my readers will remember Mr. George
Helliwell, better known to his intimates as "Yorkshire
George," and his long connection with the late Mr.
Fletcher's successful kennel of sporting dogs. It was
always a safe "draw" to touch on the merits of the
Fox Terrier "Rattler," who won many of his numerous
honours, when in George's care, and he was never
tired, and would be nearly moved to tears in recounting
his virtues and triumphs. I remember one occasion,
when he was officiating as a judge, in which capacity he
was in great request, and highly qualified. After he
had judged a class, one of the exhibitors, who was not
satisfied with what he had awarded to his dog, went up
and asked him why he had not given him more, saying
his dog "had a wonderful pedigree," and thought he
ought to have beaten all there. George said, in his
own peculiar way, slapping his inquirer gently on the
back, "If tha' tak my advice, lad, the next toime ther'
goes to show, thou'll tak thy dog's pedigree wi thee,
and leave dog at 'oom!" I fear my writing of the matter
does not properly convey the intense humour of the
incident, and the "broad Yorkshire dialect" in which
the advice was given! But "George's" many friends
will picture it for themselves.</p>

<p>I saw in the papers lately the death of Mr. Frank
Adcock, and it brought to my mind not only his
craze for Giant Bull Dogs, which is well known
to "the Fancy" of his day, but also his Great
Dane "Satan," most appropriately named, as he
rightly or wrongly enjoyed the reputation of being the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span>most savage member of the canine race ever benched
at shows. I remember him as a very large, I think,
dark Harlequin-coloured specimen of the breed, always
muzzled, even on the bench, and it usually required
two, and sometimes four, keepers to deal with
him, and on one occasion, I think it was a show at Bristol
Drill Hall, many years since, when he was being removed
from the benches to be sent back to his owner,
he, although still muzzled, overpowered his attendants,
and worried and tore most of the clothes from one of
them, well known to exhibitors as "Teddy Morgan,"
who gave me a blood-curdling account of his experiences
of the affair. He said he fully thought "Satan"
would have killed him then and there, and spoke of the
nonchalant and airy manner in which his owner treated
the matter, when he, afterwards recounted his perils
and troubles to him, with all the embellishments of
which he was capable, adding, "Mr. Adcock, he guv
me a 'quid' (20 <i>s.</i>) sir, and said he were glad it were
me, and not some raw cove what didn't understand
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span>dogs!"</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Anecdotes About Dogs, Personal and Selected</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">I have</span> generally found persons, whether doggy or
not, interested in anecdotes about dogs, particularly
those displaying their intelligence, fidelity and courage.
Some of the following are within my own knowledge,
all are related as being believed to be true. I have selected
those I fancied might be interesting out of a
great many I have collected, but some of them may
have appeared elsewhere.</p>

<p>We were telling of the extraordinary ways dogs
will find their way home, alone, when a farmer
in my district named Churchill said, "Yes, you
see that Sheep dog," pointing to a large merle,
rather old-fashioned type of Collie, called by his
master "Ben." "Well," he said, "I was down at my
daughter's in the lower part of Somersetshire, and had
taken Ben there with me, by rail, and while we were all
in the garden in the evening, I went into the house for
something or other, and Ben missed me. He at once
jumped the fence and set off on the return journey just
as darkness was coming on, but he could not have
wasted much time about it, as my servants told me he
was back at my farm, more than forty miles distant,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span>very early the next morning, and they kept looking out
for me, as we were generally not far away from each
other. I had that dog from a puppy, and I knew he had
never seen that road before, it was dark soon after he
started, yet he must have travelled at the rate of five or
six miles an hour all the way, and at a time when there
would be few people or conveyances about to help him."</p>

<p>I had a very similar experience with a dog of another
breed. I had been travelling in the island of Skye, and
bought from a game-keeper at a romantic looking village
called Uig, a young dog, which he called a Short-Haired
Skye Terrier, but which was, really, what is
now known as a Scottish, or Aberdeen Terrier, called by
the Gaelic name of "Fraochen," which I believe means
heather, and was very appropriate in his case, for he
was just that sort of brindle grizzled colour, that if he
was in the heather (as I noticed many times while he
was with me,) you could hardly distinguish him from
it.</p>

<p>After going about with us to various places, I brought
him to my mother's house at Clifton in Gloucestershire,
where I was making a short stay, and the following day
I went out for a drive over the Durdham Downs,
through Westbury, Henbury, etc., to a village, about
ten or twelve miles from Clifton, and (as I have since
thought very foolishly,) I allowed, "Fraochen," to
follow the trap, and several times during the journey,
there I noticed him running by the side, or in front, but
when we had accomplished the journey and were about
to return by a different route, I missed him, and it then
struck me, what a fool I had been, to take out a young
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span>dog, not only along a strange road, but in a country
which he had never before seen, and quite a contrast to
his native home in Skye. I of course gave him up as
lost, which I much regretted, as his cool, independent
manner and quaint, jaunty air had greatly endeared
him to me, during the time we had been acquainted.
However, when I returned to Clifton, I had to pass one
place, near where some of the houses of the Clifton college
masters now stand, where four roads meet, by one
of which I must come to reach my mother's house.
On the space in the centre, and commanding a view of
these four, sat "Fraochen," waiting our approach. How
he managed to get over the ten or twelve miles of quite
unknown country, (as I found that he, like ourselves,
came back by a different route from the one we went by,)
I do not know, but I asked several travellers we met, if
they had noticed a dog coming towards them along the
road, and most of them answered they did, and that he
was "running like steam," or he "wasn't wasting
much time about it," etc.</p>

<p>He lived with me until his death from old age,
many years afterwards but was quite a character
in many ways. One of his peculiarities was, if he
was out with my wife, with whom he was a
prime favourite, without me, he considered her under
his special protection, no matter how many or how
large any of the other dogs out at same time might be,
and if he was on, ever so far in front, and he met any
rough-looking or suspicious character of the tramp
species, he would immediately return and walk close to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span>my wife's side, so as to come between her and the objectionable person, and continue that position so long
as he was anywhere near.</p>

<p>We were talking of the speed of Greyhounds,
which has been said to be equal to that of the
fleetest horse, and a singular circumstance which occurred
at Doncaster, in Yorkshire, sometime since,
proved that it was not much inferior. A mare cantering
over the Doncaster course, her competitor having
been withdrawn, was joined by a Greyhound bitch,
when she had proceeded about a mile, she seemed determined
to race with the mare, which the jockey on the
latter humoured, and gradually increased his pace, until
at the distance, they put themselves at their full
speed. The mare beat her antagonist only by a short
head.</p>

<p>The race horse is perhaps from his superior strength
and length of stride, generally able to outrun the Greyhound
on level ground, but the latter would have the
pull over him in a hilly country, or over ground at all
rough or uneven.</p>

<p>The Greyhound is said to be deficient in attachment
to his master and in general intelligence. There
is some truth in the imputation, but he has, in fact,
far less even than the hound, the opportunity of
forming individual attachments and no other exercise
of the mind is required of him, than to follow the game
which starts up before him and catch it, if he can. If,
however, he is closely watched, he will be found to have
all the intellect his situation requires.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span>In illustration of this, I remember reading in a very
old doggy book, an account of two greyhounds said
to be as arrant thieves as ever lived. They would
now and then steal into the cooking house, belonging
to the kennels, lift up the boiler lid with their
noses or paws, and if any portion of the joints or
pieces of meat rose above the water, suddenly seize
them and before there was time for them to suffer
much from the heat, fling it out on the stone floor
and eat it at their leisure, when it had grown cold. In
order to prevent this, the top of the boiler was secured
by an iron rod, passing under its handle and tied to the
handle of the boiler on each side; and not many days
passed before they found out they could gnaw the cords
around it, displace the rod and fish out the meat as before.
Small chains were then substituted for the cords
and the meat was cooked in safety for nearly a week,
when they found that by rearing on their hind legs and
applying their united strength towards the upper part
of the boiler, they could lift it off the fire and roll it on
the floor, so getting at the soup or broth, although the
meat was not in their reach. The keeper who looked
after them expressed himself heartily glad when they
were gone, for he said he was often afraid to go into
the kennel, wondering what they would be up to next,
and felt sure they were demons, and not dogs at all.</p>

<p>A singular story is told of King Richard II. of
England, and a dog of this breed. It is given in the
quaint language of Froissart. "A Greyhound called
Mithe, who always wayted upon ye Kynge, and wolde
know no man els. For when so ever ye Kynge did ryde,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span>he that kept ye Greyhounde dyd lette hym lose, and he
wolde streyht runne to ye Kynge and faun uppon hym
and leape with his fore fete upon ye shoulders of ye
Kynge. It came to passe that onne daye as ye Kynge
and ye Erle of Darbye talked togyther in ye yarde of ye
Courte ye Greyhounde who was wonte to leape uppon
ye Kynge, left ye Kynge and came to ye Erle of Darbye,
Duke of Lancastre, and made to hym the same
friendlye continuance, and chere as he was wonte to do
to ye Kynge. The Duke, who knew not ye dogge, nor
whence he came, demanded of ye Kynge what ye Greyhounde
wolde do. Cousin, quoth ye Kynge, it is a great
good token to you, but an evyl and a gruesome signe to
me. How know ye that, quod ye Duke. I know it fulle
wele, quod ye Kynge. Ye Greyhounde acknowledgethe
and acceptethe you, here this daye as ye ryteful
Kynge of Englande, as ye shal be, without doubte, and
I shal be streyghtwaye deposed; the Greyhounde hathe
thys knowledge, naturally, there fore take hym to you,
he wil followe you and forsake me. Ye Duke wel understoode
those wordes and cheryshed ye Greyhounde,
who wolde never after followe Kynge Richarde, but
continued to follow at all tymes ye Duke of Lancastre."</p>

<p>The owner of the dog an English Water Spaniel,
tells the following anecdote, which is stated to be absolutely
true: "I was once on the seacoast, when a small,
ill-made and leaky fishing boat was cast on shore, on a
dangerous reef of rocks. Three men and a boy of ten
years, constituted the crew, the men swam to land, but
were so bruised and knocked about against the rocks
that they were unable to render any assistance to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span>poor boy, and no one was found to venture out to help
him. I heard the noise and went to the spot with my
dog, I spoke to him and in he went, more like a seal or
other marine animal, than a dog, and after several vain
attempts succeeded in mounting the wreck and laid hold
of the boy's clothes, who screamed and clung to the
ropes, etc., being much frightened at being thus
dragged into the water, as the waves were dashing over
the rocks. In the excitement and anxiety of the moment
I thought the dog had missed his hold, and
stripped off most of my clothes to render what assistance
I could. I was just in the act of springing in, having
selected the time when the receding waves gave the
best chance, when I caught sight of old Bagsman, as
my dog was called, with the struggling boy, whose head
was uppermost. I rushed to where they must land and
received both as they reached the shore.</p>

<p>Some time after I was out with the same dog, wild
fowl shooting. We had both been hard at work and
I left him behind me, while I went to a neighbouring
town to get a supply of gunpowder. A man in a
drunken frolic had pushed off in a boat with a girl
in it, the tide running out, carried the boat quickly
away, and the man being unable to swim, became
frightened and jumped overboard. Bagsman was
near the spot, heard the splash, jumped in, swam
to the man, caught hold of him and brought him
twenty or thirty yards towards shore, when the
drunken fellow clasped the dog tightly round the body,
and they both went down together. The girl was
saved by a boat going to her assistance. The body
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span>of the man was recovered about an hour afterward
with that of the dog, tightly clasped in his arms, thus
dragging both to the bottom."</p>

<p>The sagacity of the Poodle is well known, and their
aptitude to learn tricks. Mr. Wilkie, of Ladiethorn, in
Northumberland, had one he had instructed to go
through all the apparent agonies of death. He would
fall on his side, stretch himself out and move his hind
legs as if he were in great pain; he would next simulate
the convulsive throbs of departing life, and then
stretch out his limbs, and thus seem as if he had expired;
in this position he would remain motionless,
until he heard his master's command to rise.</p>

<p>Jesse, in his "Gleanings in Natural History,"
gives another illustration of the intelligence of this
breed. A friend of his had one that was not always
under proper command. To keep him in better order
he purchased a small whip, with which he, once
or twice, corrected him during a walk. On his return
the whip was put on a table in the hall, but the next
morning it was missing. Soon afterwards it was found
concealed in an outhouse, and again used in correcting
the dog. Once more it would have been lost, but on a
strict watch being kept upon the suspected dog, he was
seen to take it away from the hall table in order to once
more hide it away.</p>

<p>There are endless stories told of the life saving
qualities of Newfoundland dogs. I will here
mention two of them. A German was travelling
one evening on foot through the Dyke country in Holland,
accompanied by a large specimen of this breed,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span>walking on a high bank which formed one side of a
dyke, his foot slipped and he was precipitated into the
water, and being unable to swim soon lost his senses.
When he recovered consciousness, he found himself in
a cottage on the other side of the dyke, surrounded by
peasants, who had been using the means for the recovery
of drowned persons. The account given him
by one of them was, that returning home from work
he observed, some distance off, a large dog in the water,
swimming and dragging, and sometimes pushing along
something that he seemed to have great difficulty in
supporting, but which he at length succeeded in getting
into a small creek on the opposite side. When the animal
had pulled what he had hitherto supported, as far
out of the water as he was able, the peasant was able
to discover that it was the body of a man, whose face
and hands the dog was industriously licking. He
hastened to a bridge across the dyke, and having obtained
assistance, the body was conveyed to a neighbouring
house, where proper means soon restored the
drowning man to life. Two very considerable bruises,
with the marks of teeth, appeared one on his shoulder
and the other on his poll, hence it was presumed the
faithful beast had first seized his master by the shoulder
and swam with him in this manner for sometime,
but that his sagacity had prompted him to quit this hold
and to shift it to the nape of the neck, by which he had
been enabled to support the head out of the water and
in this way he had conveyed him, nearly a quarter of
a mile, before he had brought him to the creek where
the banks were low and accessible.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</a></span>Another story runs as follows: A vessel was
driven on the beach at Lydd in Kent. The surf
was rolling furiously. Eight poor fellows were
crying for help, but no boat could be got off for
their assistance. At length a gentleman came down
to the beach accompanied by a fine Newfoundland
dog, he directed the attention of the animal to the
vessel and put a short stick into his mouth. The intelligent
and courageous fellow at once understood his
meaning, sprang into the sea, and fought his way
through the waves. He could not, however, on account
of the high seas running, get close enough to the vessel
to deliver that with which he was charged, but the crew
understood what was meant, made fast a rope to another
piece of wood and threw it towards him. The
noble beast dropped his own piece of wood, and seized
that which had been cast to him, and then, with a degree
of strength and determination scarcely credible,
for he was again and again lost sight of in the roaring
sea, he dragged it through the surge and delivered it to
his master. A line of communication was thus formed,
and every man on board was rescued.</p>

<p>Referring to some of the breeds peculiar to northern
climes the following is told: A man named
Chabert had a beautiful Siberian dog, who would
draw him in a light carriage twenty miles a day.
He asked £200 for him, and sold him for nearly
that amount, for he was a most beautiful specimen
of his breed, and as docile as he was beautiful.
Between the sale and the delivery, the dog had an
accident and broke his leg. Chabert, to whom the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</a></span>money was an object of immense importance, was in
despair. He took the dog at night to a leading veterinary
surgeon. He formally introduced them to each
other, he talked to the dog, pointed to his leg, limped
round the room, then requested the surgeon to apply
some bandages, etc., round the leg and then seemed to
walk sound and well, he patted the dog on the head,
who was looking alternately at him and the surgeon,
desired the surgeon to pat him and offer him his hand
to lick, and then holding up his finger to the dog and
gently shaking his head, quitted the room and the
house. The dog immediately laid himself down,
and submitted to a reduction of the fracture
and the bandaging of the limb, without a motion,
except once or twice, licking the hand of
the operator. He was quite docile, and remained
in a manner motionless, day after day, until at
the expiration of a month, the limb was sound. Not a
trace of the fracture was to be detected and the purchaser
knew nothing of it.</p>

<p>Many years ago, the following scene took place in a
street adjoining Hanover Square. It was an exhibition
of a highly interesting character, worthy to be recorded.
The then editor of the "Lancet" having
heard that a French gentleman, Mr. Leonard,
who had for some time been engaged in instructing
two dogs in various performances, that required
the exercise, not merely of the natural instincts
of the animals and the power of imitation, but of a
higher intellect and degrees of reflection and judgment
far greater than is commonly developed in dogs, was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</a></span>then residing in London, obtained an introduction, and
was obligingly favoured by Mr. Leonard, with an appointment
to witness the performance of his extraordinary
pupils, and he thus describes the interview:</p>

<p>Two fine dogs of the Spanish breed were introduced
by Mr. Leonard, with the customary French politeness,
the largest by the name of Philax, the other as Brac (or
Spot), the former had been in training three, the latter
two years. They were in vigourous health, and having
bowed gracefully, took their seats on the hearth rug
side by side. Mr. Leonard then gave a lively
description of the means he had employed to
develop the brain power of these animals, how
from being fond of the chase and anxious to
possess the best trained dogs, he had employed
the usual course of training, how the conviction
had been impressed on his mind, that by gentle usage
and steady perseverance in making the animal repeat
over and over again, what was wanted, not only would
he be capable of performing the act required, but the
part of the brain which was brought into mental activity
by the effort, would become more fully developed
and a permanent increase of power obtained.</p>

<p>After this introduction, Mr. Leonard spoke to
his dogs in French in his usual tone, ordering one
to walk, the other to lie down, to run, gallop,
halt, crouch, etc., which they did as promptly and
correctly as the most docile children. Then he
put them through the usual exercises of the circus
rings, which they performed as well as the best
trained ponies at any high class circus. He then placed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</a></span>six cards of different colours on the floor, and sitting
with his back to the dogs, directed one to pick up the
blue card, and the other the white one, etc., etc., varying
his orders rapidly, and speaking in such a manner
that unless the dogs had a perfect knowledge of the
words used, they could not have carried out his commands.
For example, he said, "Philax, take the red
card and give it to Brac," and "Brac, take the white
card and give it to Philax." The dogs instantly did this
and exchanged cards with each other. He then said,
"Philax, put your card on the green," and "Brac, put
yours on the blue," and this was immediately done.
Pieces of bread and meat were placed on the floor, also
figured cards and varied directions and instructions
were given to the dogs, so as severely to test their
memories, obedience and intelligence. They brought
the bread, meat, or cards, as commanded, but did not
attempt to eat any of the two former, unless ordered to
do so. Philax was then desired to fetch a piece of meat
and give it to Brac, and then Brac was told to give it
back to Philax, who was to return it to its place. Philax
was next told he might bring a piece of bread and eat
it, but before he had time to swallow it, his master forbade
him and desired him to show he had obeyed orders,
and the dog instantly protruded the crust between
his lips. While some of these feats were being performed,
Mr. Leonard loudly cracked a whip occasionally,
to prove that the animals were so completely under
discipline that they would give no heed to any
noises or interruptions.</p>

<p>After many other performances Mr. Leonard invited
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</a></span>Mr. Blanc, a gentleman present, to play a game
of dominoes with one of his dogs, which he consented
to do. The younger dog, Brac, seated himself on a chair
at the table and Messrs. Leonard and Blanc seated
themselves opposite. Six dominoes were placed on their
edges, in the usual way, before the dog and the same
number before Mr. Blanc. The dog having amongst its
numbers a double number, took it up in its mouth and
dropped it in the centre of the table, Mr. Blanc added a
single number to one side of it, the dog at once played
another correctly, and so on, till all the pieces were used
up. A fresh lot of six dominoes were then served out
to each competitor and Mr. Blanc (just to test the dog)
intentionally put a wrong number in the course of the
game. The dog looked surprised and excited, stared
hard at Mr. Blanc, growled, and finally barked loudly.
Finding no notice taken of his remonstrances, he then
pushed away the wrong domino, with his nose, and put
a right number, from amongst his own, in its place. Mr.
Blanc afterwards continued the play correctly and the
game was won by the dog. Not the slightest hint or information
appeared to be given by Mr. Leonard to the
dog. This method of playing a game of dominoes must
have been entirely the result of his individual observation
and judgment. The performance was strictly private
throughout, the owner of the dogs was a gentleman
of independent fortune, and had taken up the instruction
of his dogs merely as a curious and amusing
investigation as to the cultivated intelligence of animals.</p>

<p>Plutarch relates that, at the Theatre of Marcellus,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</a></span>a dog was exhibited before the Emperor Vespasian
so well taught, as to perform the figures and steps
of every (then) known kind of dance. He afterwards
feigned illness in a most singular manner, so as to
strike the spectators with astonishment. He first exhibited
various symptoms of pain, then fell down as if
dead, afterwards seemed to revive, gradually, as if
waking from a profound sleep and then frisked and
sported about, giving meanwhile various demonstrations
of joy and delight.</p>

<p>It is surprising the antipathy which sometimes
exists between inmates of the same kennels, I have
had several instances of it in the course of a long
experience with most breeds. I remember some
years ago I had a Skye Terrier bitch, called "Wasp,"
and a Pepper Dandie bitch, known as "Hornet,"
which we generally characterised as "The Insects,"
and very stinging insects they were, if they happened
to meet. One day when I was driving in the dog
cart to the railway station, at that time about a six-mile
drive to the nearest town to where I was living,
and as we were going along, I thought I heard a humming
sound, and said to my kennelman who was with
me, "Jump down, Hale, I believe those Insects are at
it!" and I was right. They had eaten through the sides
of their baskets, and got at each other, through the
holes, and were fairly enjoying themselves on the journey.
We managed to keep them apart the rest of the
way to the show they were bound for. I cannot recall
what the place was, but I well remember that "Hornet,"
who although quite a little creature, was a perfect
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</a></span>demon with others of her own race, though
sweet tempered, and most engaging with human beings,
broke three chains I bought there, two of them
new ones, in order to get again at "Wasp," before
they left the show to return home. Their portraits appear
in one of my pictures with pony, my children and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</a></span>dogs, and are very like them.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIX" id="CHAPTER_XIX"></a>CHAPTER XIX</h2>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Anecdotes About Dogs</span> (<i>Continued</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> these days, when so much has been attempted and
done, in connection with expeditions to the Arctic regions,
the following account by the late Captain Parry,
R. N. in the Journal of his second voyage, may be interesting
as giving a lively and accurate description of
the manner in which Esquimaux Dogs are managed
in the sleighing operations in those inclement climes.</p>

<p>"When drawing a sledge," says he, "the dogs have
a simple harness of reindeer or seal skin, going round
the neck of one bight and another for each of the fore
legs, with a single thong leading over the back, and attached
to the sledge, as a trace.</p>

<p>"Though they appear, at first sight, to be huddled
together without any regard to regularity, there is, in
fact, considerable attention paid to their arrangement,
particularly in the selection of a dog of
peculiar spirit and sagacity, who is allowed by a
longer trace, to precede all the rest, as Leader, and to
whom, in turning to the right or left, the driver usually
addresses himself.</p>

<p>"This choice is made without regard to age or sex,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</a></span>and the rest of the dogs take precedency according to
their training or sagacity, the least effective being put
nearest the sledge.</p>

<p>"The leader is, usually, from eighteen to twenty
feet from the fore part of the sledge and the hindmost
dog about half that distance, so that, when ten or twelve
are running together several are nearly abreast of each
other.</p>

<p>"The driver sits quite low on the front part of the
sledge, with his feet overhanging the snow on one side,
and having in his hand a whip, of which the handle is
plaited a little way down to stiffen it, and give it a
spring, on which much of its use depends, and that
which composes the lash is chewed by the women to
make it flexible in frosty weather.</p>

<p>"The men acquire, from their youth, considerable
expertness in the use of this whip. The lash
is left to trail along the ground by the side of the
sledge, and with it they can inflict a very severe blow
upon any one of the dogs at pleasure.</p>

<p>"Though the dogs are kept in training solely
and entirely by the fear of the whip, and, indeed
without it would soon have their own way, its
immediate effect is always detrimental to the draught
of the sledge, for not only does the individual
that is struck draw back and slacken his pace, but
generally turns upon his next neighbour, and this
passing on to the next occasions a general divergency,
accompanied by the usual yelping and showing
of teeth. The dogs then come together again by degrees,
and the pace of the sledge is quickened; but even
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</a></span>at the best of times, by this rude mode of draught, (and
be it remembered the <i>only one</i>, in these inclement parts
of the world,) the traces of one-third of the dogs
form an angle of thirty or forty degrees on each side
of the direction in which the sledge is advancing.</p>

<p>"Another great inconvenience attending the Esquimaux
method of putting dogs to, besides that of not
employing their strength to the best advantage, is the
constant entanglement of the traces by the dogs repeatedly
doubling under from side to side to avoid the
whip, so that, after running a few miles, the traces always
require to be taken off and cleared.</p>

<p>"In directing the sledge, the whip plays no very essential
part, the driver for this purpose using certain
words, as the carters do with us, to make the dogs turn
more to the right or left. To these, a good leader attends
with admirable precision, especially if his own
name be repeated, at the same time looking behind over
his shoulder with great earnestness, as if listening to
the directions of the driver.</p>

<p>"On a beaten track, or where even a single foot, or
sledge mark is visible, or occasionally discernible, there
is not the slightest trouble in guiding the dogs; for
even in the darkest night, and in the heaviest snow
drifts, there is little or no danger of them losing their
road, the leader keeping his nose near the ground, and
directing the rest with wonderful sagacity.</p>

<p>"Where, however, there is no beaten track, the best
driver amongst them, makes a terribly circuitous
course, as all the Esquimaux roads plainly show; these
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</a></span>generally occupying an extent of six miles, when with
a horse and sledge the journey would scarcely have
amounted to five!</p>

<p>"On rough ground, as on hummocks of ice, the
sledge would be frequently overturned, or altogether
stopped, if the driver did not repeatedly
get off and by lifting or drawing it on one side, steer
clear of those accidents. At all times, indeed, except
on a smooth and well made road, he is pretty constantly
employed, thus, with his feet, which, together
with his never ceasing vociferations and frequent use
of the whip, renders the driving of one of these vehicles
by no means an easy or a pleasant task.</p>

<p>"When the driver wishes to stop the sledge, he
calls out 'Wo, woa,' exactly as our carters do, but the
attention paid to this command depends altogether on
his ability to enforce it. If the weight is small and the
journey homeward, the dogs are not to be thus delayed,
the driver is obliged therefore to dig his heels into the
snow, to obstruct their progress, and having thus succeeded
in stopping them, he stands up with one leg before
the foremost cross-piece of the sledge, till by
means of gently laying his whip over each dog's head,
he has made them all lie down. Even then, he takes
care not to quit his position; so that, should the dogs
set off, he is thrown upon the sledge instead of being
left behind by them.</p>

<p>"With heavy loads, the dogs draw best with one of
their own people, especially a woman, walking a little
way ahead, and in this case they are sometimes enticed
to mend their pace by holding a mitten to the mouth
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</a></span>and then making the motion of cutting it with a knife
and throwing it on the snow, when the dogs, mistaking
it for meat, hasten forward to pick it up. The women
also entice them from the huts in a similar manner. The
rate at which they travel depends of course on the
weight they have to draw and the roads on which the
journey is performed.</p>

<p>"When the latter is level and very hard and
smooth constituting in other parts of North America
what is called 'good sleighing,' six or seven
dogs will draw from eight to ten hundredweight
at the rate of seven or eight miles an hour, for several
hours together, and will easily, under these circumstances,
perform a journey of from fifty to sixty miles
a day. On untrodden snow, five and twenty, or thirty
miles would be a good journey in a day.</p>

<p>"The same number of well-fed dogs with five or six
hundredweight behind them, that of the sledge included,
are almost unmanageable, and will, on a
smooth road, run any way they please at the rate of
ten miles an hour. The work performed, however, by
a greater number of dogs is, by no means, in proportion
to this, owing to the imperfect mode already described
of utilising the strength of these sturdy creatures
and to the more frequent snarling and fighting
occasioned by the increase in numbers of the draught
team or teams."</p>

<p>I have no doubt all owners of kennels have noticed
the sudden antipathies taken by dogs sometimes
to their own comrades and companions. I
remember several instances, amongst my dogs; one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</a></span>was between two remarkably quiet and unassuming Bull Bitches, Louisa and Lucretia, who lived
together in a roomy kennel for a long time, but
one night there was such a great noise amongst
all the dogs that I felt sure there must be something
serious going on, so I got up and dressed
sufficiently to go down, and found that although the
barking and yelling was being done by the Sheep Dogs,
Terriers, etc., the "business" lay entirely between the
two ladies mentioned, who were simply locked together,
and I had a nasty job to get and keep them
apart, as it really wants two persons to deal with two
determined "boxers," but at last, I got one outside,
and the other inside the loose box, and then managed
all right.</p>

<p>Another case I had was the two well-known champions,
Rob Roy and Laird, two of the best Dandies
going at the time they were about. Neither of
them had any idea what fear was, but each hated the
other with the most deadly hatred, and even to hear
the bark of the one, would set the other screaming to
get at him, and yet they were both docile with people,
and mostly with other dogs, but Laird had a particular
dislike to any dog, running in front of a vehicle and
barking at the horse, and this aversion was the cause of
his sudden death. Cedar Lodge, Downend, Glo.,
where I then lived, was the corner of one of four roads,
with a large lawn on the two front sides of it, and it
was Laird's delight to sit on the top of a low wall,
there, and watch the passers by; one morning, early, he
was thus engaged, when a crank axle cart came rumbling
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</a></span>along, accompanied by a good-sized dog, barking
in front of the horse; this was too much for Laird, who
sprang from the wall into the road and pinned the dog,
and before the man could pull up his horse, the wheels
of the cart had gone over the fighting dogs in the road
with fatal effects on one of the combatants, as Laird,
without a whimper, though he must have been seriously
injured, walked slowly into the house, lay down
in his own box, and died then and there!</p>

<p>Another case of sudden antipathy I remember
was between two Skye Bitches of mine, Laura and
Lucy (winners of some fifty prizes at all the best
shows, while they were about), I bought, on the dispersal
of Mrs. Jacobson's kennel, after her lamented
death. She was a genuine fancier, and sportswoman,
and all her dogs were sure to be "workers,"
and thoroughly game. One of them was
drop-eared, and the other prick-eared, and for a
long time they were the best of friends, and not only
lived together in one kennel, but used to go to shows
often considerable distances, such as Edinburgh, Darlington,
and other places in a long low wicker basket,
which just suited them without any partition or division
in it. But one day they had some difference of
opinion, the cause of which I do not know, but there
were "ructions," and they never could be trusted together
again without the certainty of "war to the
knife."</p>

<p>James Hogg, well known as the Ettrick shepherd,
declares in his "Shepherd's Calendar" that dogs know
what is said on subjects in which they are interested.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</a></span>A farmer had a dog that for three or four years in the
latter part of his life, met him at the foot of his farm,
about a mile and a half from his house, on his way
home. If he was away half a day, a week, or a fortnight,
it was all the same, she met him at that spot,
there was never an instance known of her going to
meet him, on a wrong day, and she could only know
when he was coming back, by hearing it mentioned in
the family.</p>

<p>I have had many dogs who knew Sunday perfectly
well, whether by hearing the church bells, or
other indications of the day, I do not know, but although
wild to go if they saw me going out at any
other time, on that day, they would take no
notice nor make any attempt to follow me.</p>

<p>In the same way I have had many thin-coated
dogs such as Bull and English Terriers, Smooth
Toys and Pugs, who would not go out willingly
in wet weather, but Sheep Dogs, Dalmatians,
Deerhounds, Dandies, Scottish, Skyes and Wirehaired
Fox Terriers, take no notice of it, beyond occasionally
shaking themselves, to get rid of some of the water.</p>

<p>Another of Hogg's tales is as follows: "One of my
Sheep dogs, named Hector, was very keen in picking
up what was said before him." One day Hogg said to
his mother, "I am going to Bowerhope to-morrow for
a fortnight, but I will not take Hector with me, for he
is constantly quarrelling with the rest of the dogs."
Hector was present and must have overheard
the conversation, as next morning he was missing,
and when Hogg reached Bowerhope, Hector
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</a></span>was sitting on a hillock, waiting his arrival, he had swum across a flooded river to reach the
spot.</p>

<p>Retrievers have the reputation, either rightly or
wrongly, of being quarrelsome with other dogs,
and so are more often kept as guards or for
sporting work, than as companions or pets, but the following
are recorded of their sagacity. The inmates of
a house in High street in a well-known city were
aroused by the loud barking of a dog on the premises.
He was a large Black Retriever, Jack, much attached to
his master and family. The cause of alarm was soon
seen to be a fire raging furiously next door, the smoke
from which had aroused the dog. In a short time the
house was emptied, all the inmates escaping before it
caught fire, which appeared inevitable. Jack was often
used to be left in charge of the house when the family
were temporarily absent, and although not tied up, no
persuasion or even coaxing would induce him to desert
his post, so much so that it was four hours after he had
given the first alarm of fire, that he allowed one of the
family to persuade him to leave the building, which
was then almost "gutted." In a marvellous manner,
he had escaped injury from the fire, or falling walls,
rafters, etc., but the shock to the system from the inhalation
of smoke, etc., was so severe, that it caused
inflammation of the lungs, and he died the next day,
after suffering with coughing, etc., really a martyr to
what he looked upon as his duty, and though occasionally
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</a></span>taking a little water, refusing all food.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Anecdotes About Dogs</span> (<i>Continued</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Another</span> instance of sagacity occurred at Bristol,
when a nursemaid wheeling a perambulator with a
baby in it, down Spring Hill, which those of my readers
who know the locality, will remember, is one of the
steepest in that hilly part of the country, was seized
with a fit, and loosened her hold. In an instant the little
vehicle, with its living occupant, was darting down
towards a flight of steps in the hill and apparently to
certain destruction. Just before its arrival at the steps,
the leathern apron of the perambulator was seized
by a Retriever dog, who happened to witness the occurrence,
and saw the danger of it, the vehicle was stopped
and the child saved from an untimely death.</p>

<p>The natural love of fun and inclination for being
taught almost anything of the Irish Water Spaniel is
well known, so that I think the following account by
Mr. Lindhoe, R.E., at one time a keen fancier and exhibitor,
of his Rake and Blaeney, may be interesting to
my readers.</p>

<p>He writes: "Rake is a very clever dog and
can be taught almost any trick. He is very tender-mouthed
and can dive and bring up an egg, unbroken,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</a></span>from a depth of twelve feet or more. It is very amusing also to see him take sixpence out of a bucket of
water, as he sometimes has his head under nearly two
minutes before picking it up. I taught him a very
clever trick which used to cause much amusement at
the shows. Whenever he was disturbed by any one
poking at him with a stick to make him rouse up and
show himself, he would rise gently, put his fore paws
on the shoulders of the disturber of his rest, and before
it was guessed what idea he had in view, seize and take
off the man's hat and deposit it in the pan of water, or
on the straw in his pen. Blaeney also is wonderfully
clever, and a splendid hand at sport on land or in
water. After a game of croquet is finished, she invariably
brings in the hoops, mallets, balls, etc., and places
them in their proper box in the hall. Once when I was
engaged in separating four large Mastiffs who were
fighting, she came to my rescue, and considering the
best way of rendering assistance, seized the most stubborn
of the combatants by the tail and held on till the
fight was stopped. She would retrieve very long distances
and often surprised people by seizing some stick
or other article, which had been put down on purpose
for her to fetch, and they had unknowingly picked up.
I have frequently known both these dogs jump into
the water from a distance of nearly thirty feet."</p>

<p>I remember, on a recent occasion, when I had promised
to judge at one of our largest London shows, having
the impression the show opened on the Tuesday, I
went up on the Monday, and did not discover my mistake
until I got to the hotel I usually patronised for any
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</a></span>show in that part of the metropolis, but as I have always
any amount of places and people to see, I own I did not
trouble about the matter, and had nearly forgotten it
until at the show I met a gentleman also hailing from
the same part of England and a well-known light in the
Beagle world, who said: "I did an unusual thing this
time, came up a day too soon, and I shall get a pretty
'roasting' over it." I replied: "I also did the same for
the first time, in a long experience of Dog shows, but
do not expect any 'roasting.'" He said, "Oh, but my
wife will know it, if no one else does, and she will never
forget it." I answered, "Neither my wife, nor any one
else, will know it, from me, as I don't believe (any more
than the late Mr. Sam Weller) in telling matters
against myself." But as I see the gentleman referred to
has followed the example of the late Mr. Silas Wegg
(in Our Mutual Friend) and "dropped into poetry,"
in the pages of a well known fancier's paper, it may
amuse some of our mutual friends if I quote the lines

<p>Many of the older exhibitors will remember the late
Mr. I. H. Murchison, F. R. G. S., whose large and successful
kennel of St. Bernards, Dandies, and Fox
Terriers, was for so many years in the front rank at
all the leading shows? As I was much mixed up in
the two last named varieties, I used constantly to be in
his company, and that of his son, also a keen and capable
fancier. I remember on one occasion meeting him at
a show, I forget where it was, now, I think in the London
district, but amongst the dogs he had there was a
young and very promising Fox Terrier, called "Cracknel,"
with which he had carried all before him, and he
showed me a letter he had received from a gentleman
then, as now, in the front rank of Fox Terrier breeders,
and exhibitors, offering him £270 for the dog, and
he said, since receipt of the letter, the writer had offered
to make it "even money" (£300), at that time,
quite a fancy price for a specimen of that breed. He
said, "What would you advise me to do about it?" I
said, "Why take it, without hesitation, it is a tempting
price, the life of all dogs is uncertain, and show dogs,
especially, and it will do your kennel more good to have
sold a dog from it, at such a figure, than anything you
can gain, in any other way." However, he refused
the offer, and Cracknel not long afterwards rushed
into a hayfield after a rabbit, or rat, and so cut himself
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</a></span>with a scythe hidden in the long grass that he had to be
sewn up and was long in the veterinary surgeon's care
and was never in the front rank again!</p>

<p>I have known many such cases of good offers being
refused to the prejudice of the dog's owners. I remember
a well-known lady exhibitor coming up to me at a
show with a telegram she had just received
from America, offering her £150 for a prize
winning pug she had, and asking my advice.
I strongly advised her to take it, as it was far
more than the market value of the dog, but, in the end,
she sent back a refusal. Other dogs came forward, and
put her dog into the rear rank, and she afterwards sold
it for, I think, about £20.</p>

<p>Mr. Edwin Nichols, of whom I have spoken in
relation to several large breeds, was one of the
first men to get large prices for his dogs, as it
must be quite twenty years or more since he received
so he told me, £900 for two dogs, one of them being
the well known Mastiff, "Turk," one of the grandest
specimens of his day, and the other a high class Bloodhound.</p>

<p>And to show what a fine judge he was as to
the strains to breed, I remember an instance he gave me
from his extensive experience. He met a friend one
day to whom he had sold a Bloodhound bitch puppy,
who said, "Mr. Nichols, I wish you would take back
that puppy I had from you, it is always doing mischief
in the garden, etc., and I wish to get rid of it." Mr.
Nichols said, "I really don't want it, I have a lot of
dogs of all ages, and I am more a seller than a buyer at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</a></span>present." To make a long story short, he eventually
took back the young bitch for £10, afterward mating
her to one of his best dogs, and he told me that he sold
that litter, which produced two if not three champions,
for over one thousand pounds. I say, that a man who
could do such a thing, proved himself a consummate
judge, and I have not the slightest doubt of the truth
of the story, and, when he named the dogs in the litter
to me, I knew what grand specimens of the breed they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[Pg 353]</a></span>were.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Anecdotes About Dogs</span> (<i>Continued</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">I have</span> mentioned the "Warwick Shows" of days
gone by, and what charming re-unions they were. I
think the incident which follows must have been at the
first of them, for although I had known Mr. Nichols by
sight and name, I did not think I was known to him.
I remember I had reached Warwick in the afternoon,
engaged a bed at the Globe Hotel (where they told me
mine was a double bedded room, and I stipulated that
the other bed should not be occupied without my consent),
and went to the show, and meeting with many
friends there, it was late when I got back. I then found
Mr. Nichols waiting to see who I was, as it seemed
the other bed in my room was the only one unoccupied
in the town. I had not left my name, and the hotel
people's description did not enlighten him, but he said,
"Whoever it is, if he knows anything about dogs, or
doggy men, he will know me!" and so it proved. We
had, as always afterwards whenever we met, a long
talk on subjects congenial to us both, and he secured
the "last bed of Warwick!"</p>

<p>Amongst the many weaknesses to which I plead
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[Pg 354]</a></span>guilty, is a devoted admiration of the works of the
late Charles Dickens, some of which came out in
their green coloured numbers, while I was a schoolboy,
and it was the delight of my brothers and
self, to sit and listen to them being read out to us by
our dear mother, who had a gift in that direction. I
hope my readers will pardon my giving here, a very
short doggy story, from Pickwick Papers, in the pithy,
disjointed sentences of "Mr. Alfred Jingle," as I wish
to give something, however slight, about nearly every
breed, and the anecdotes about Pointers are not very
numerous. "Ah! you should keep dogs, fine animals,
sagacious creatures. Dog of my own once, Pointer, surprising
instinct, out shooting one day, entering enclosure,
whistled, dog stopped, whistled again, Ponto! no
go; stock still, called him, 'Ponto, Ponto,' no go, stock
still, wouldn't move, dog transfixed, staring at a board,
looked up, saw an inscription, 'Gamekeeper has orders
to shoot all dogs found in this enclosure,' wouldn't
pass it, wonderful dog, valuable dog that, very.
'Singular circumstance that,' said Mr. Pickwick,
'Will you allow me to make a note of it?' 'Certainly,
sir, certainly, hundred more anecdotes of the same animal.'"</p>

<p>At the risk of its being considered "a chestnut," I
will here recount the story of the dogs of Oldacre, so
well told by the late William Howitt, in his "Boys'
Country Book" (one of the prime favourites of my
boyhood). "This story brings to my recollection,
those two noble dogs at Oldacre, two grand Setters
that Squire Mills used always to have at his heels,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[Pg 355]</a></span>whether it was shooting season or not, just one the
picture of the other, as like as pin to pin or pear to
pear!</p>

<p>Well, Squire Mills had an estate in Oxfordshire,
a hundred miles off at least; and there he used
to go twice a year to receive his rents, and he never
went, while he had those dogs, without taking one of
them with him. When the dog was tired he let him
go up into his chaise and ride, and when he was tired
of riding, the dog leaped out and jogged along again
till he was tired again.</p>

<p>Squire Mills always stopped at the Mitre Inn
at Oxford, and it so happened, on one occasion,
that as his Setter followed him up the stable
yard, a great mastiff, which was chained to a kennel,
suddenly rushed out, seized on the Setter, and before
he could be beaten off, had very severely worried him.
Squire Mills was very angry, and the innkeeper made
many apologies, but that did not cure the dog's wounds,
and the Squire, who said he would rather have given
five pounds than the dog had been so used, set off
homeward in no very good humour.</p>

<p>The dog, which seemed very much hurt, lay whining
and appearing very uneasy, in the bottom of the chaise,
all the way home, and when they got there the keeper
was ordered to pay every attention to him, and do all
that he could for him. But the dog lay in his kennel
for more than a week, and seemed in a very poor way,
indeed. He would not eat, and the keeper was very
doubtful what would be the upshot of it, when, one
morning he was very much surprised to find, both he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[Pg 356]</a></span>and his fellow dog missing.</p>

<p>All inquiries were made, but nothing could be
heard of them and it was concluded they were
stolen. The squire immediately offered five and twenty
guineas for the discovery of the thief; but no thief was
heard of, or the dogs either, till a week afterwards,
when they again entered the yard, but two such poor
jaded, worn-down creatures as never were seen.</p>

<p>They were, apparently, starved to the very point of
death, covered with dust, and in fact, in such a condition
that notwithstanding all that could be done, they
both died in the course of a few days. On examining
them after death, they appeared to have been shot at,
various shot-corns being found in their skins.</p>

<p>Nothing, however, came to light about it; and on
the next rent day the Squire made his journey into Oxfordshire
without either of his favourite dogs.</p>

<p>As he passed the kennel of the Mastiff in the Inn
Yard, at Oxford, he could not help looking, with resentment,
towards it, when to his surprise, instead
of the Mastiff, which had been there many years, he
saw quite another dog. "And so you have parted
with that savage brute of a Mastiff that worried my
setter the last time I was here," he said to the
Ostler. "Ay," replied the Ostler, "there's a curious
thing about that, sir, the dog was worried, dead on the
spot, at the door of his own kennel, and if I am not mistaken,
your setter helped to do it too." "My setter,"
said the Squire, "what do you mean?" "I mean,
sir," said the man, "that about a week or so after you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[Pg 357]</a></span>was here last, when your dog got so towsled by old
Sampson, the Mastiff, we heard all of a sudden a terrible
noise of dogs fighting in the yard, and on running
out, saw two great dogs fiercely at work with
old Sampson. They had got him down, and seemed
tearing him into very atoms. Our master made no
more to do, but in he ran, snatched down the gun, and
fired at the dogs, but it was too late, they were just
going over the yard wall together, and I dare say, got
off without the peppering master meant for them. But
there, however, was old Sampson, as dead as the stones
he lay upon!" "And you thought," said the Squire,
"that one of the dogs resembled my setter?" "Nay,"
said the Ostler, "both of them. One was the very
picture of the other, and if they were not your setters,
they were no dogs at all!" "It is very wonderful,"
said the Squire, "but I have not a doubt but that you
are quite right in your belief, and this accounts for
what, till this moment, has very much puzzled me. My
dog was so resentful of the injury and insult that he
received from your Mastiff, that he without doubt communicated
his grievances to his brother dog, and prevailed
on him to set out on a pilgrimage of revenge.
The dogs disappeared for a week or more together,
they came back wounded, and in that miserable
plight, that they never recovered it. The
dogs, let me tell you, are both dead, and I
would not have taken a hundred pounds for
them." The Ostler and all the people about the inn
were wonderfully surprised at the story, and a wonderful
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[Pg 358]</a></span>circumstance it was, to be sure. My grandfather,
who told the story, added, "It is just as true as you sit
there, I had it word for word, nay, I have had it, word
for word, twenty times, from Squire Mills himself."</p>

<p>Of course in a long career of dog showing and judging
I have come into contact with all classes of exhibitors,
and I am bound to say, as a general rule, have
met with the greatest courtesy and had many a kind
turn done me at different times, nor was I ever, but
once, the subject of any of the practical jokes which
used to be, more than they are now, so very frequent,
and sometimes very rough, and unpleasant in their
nature.</p>

<p>The one exception was when I was stopping at
Sydenham, on the occasion of a Crystal Palace show,
and when I rose in the morning to go up and see
my dogs before breakfast, my boots could nowhere be
found, but as I knew there was a very lively team stopping
at the same hotel, I felt certain it was their doing,
and resolved to checkmate them by going to see the
dogs all the same and saying nothing about it, so as I
always carried in my bag a pair of Indian leather moccasins,
I put them on, and went over to the Palace,
where I presently met one of the squad I suspected of
"lifting my boots," he said, "What funny shoes you
have on, Mr. Lane." I said, "Yes, they are a little out
of the common, but, the fact is, some of the jokers at
my hotel, have taken a fancy to my boots and
probably supposed I should be kept a prisoner
in the hotel all day, and so I put on these,"
he said, "You don't mean to say, <i>your</i> boots
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[Pg 359]</a></span>were taken. They've taken the wrong man's; no one
had the slightest idea of playing any prank on you,"
and when I returned, I found my boots in my room.</p>

<p>I came across, in an old French work, the following
curious, if true, method of fishing, in which the services
of a Poodle, or Terrier were called into action. The
enthusiastic sportsman who fears neither storms nor
sunstroke (<i>coup de soleil</i>) makes his appearance at the
Riverside without either fishing rod, lines, worms, flies
or bait, of any description, but having under his left
arm a double-barrelled gun, in his right hand, a large
cabbage and following at his heels a clever Poodle or
Terrier dog. The fisherman, or huntsman, I scarcely
know which to call him, now duly reconnoitres the
river, fixes upon some tree, the large and lower
branches of which hang out over the water, ascends
with his gun and cabbage, and having taken up his position
upon one of the large projecting branches,
closely examines the surface of the stream beneath him.</p>

<p>He has, usually, not been long on his perch, before he
perceives a stately pike, or other member of the finny
tribe, paddling up the river, he instantly breaks a leaf
off the cabbage, and when the fish has approached sufficiently
near, throws it into the water, the frightened
fish immediately disappears, but shortly after rises, and
grateful to the kind and unknown friend who has provided
this admirable parasol, swims towards it, and
after pushing it about for a while with his nose, finally
places himself comfortably under its protecting and
congenial shade.</p>

<p>The sportsman in the tree, watching the animated
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[Pg 360]</a></span>movements of the cabbage leaf, immediately fires,
when the dog, whose sagacity is quite equal to that
of his master, plunges into the water, and if the fish
is either dead or severely wounded, seldom fails to
bring the scaly morsel to land; thus as long as the
heavens are bright and blue, the water keeps warm on
the surface and the larger fish prefer to swim in the
sun, the sport continues so long as the climbing and
staying powers of the sportsman hold out. Sometimes
the dog and fish have a very sharp struggle, and then
the fun is great indeed unless, by chance, the sportsman
should unfortunately miss his footing in the tree, in the
midst of his amusement and drop head foremost into
the water with his double-barrelled gun and what is
left of his cabbage.</p>

<p>I think it may be interesting here to quote the
eulogistic terms in which Mr. Burchell, the well-known
African traveller, wrote of his dogs, as he had a considerable
experience of the breed in the course of his
long and perilous journeys in that (at the time he was
there) almost unknown country.</p>

<p>"Our pack of dogs," says he, "consisted of five and
twenty, of various sorts and sizes. This great variety,
though not altogether intentional, as I was obliged to
take any that could be procured and were at all likely
to answer my purposes, was often of the greater service
to me, as I observed, some gave notice of danger,
or their suspicions of it, in one way, and others in
quite a different manner. Some were more disposed to
keep watch against men, others against wild beasts of
prey, and others for animals and birds of sport; some
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[Pg 361]</a></span>discovered an enemy by their quickness of hearing,
others by that of scent; some were useful for speed in
pursuing game, some for their vigilance and barking,
and others for their courage in holding ferocious animals
at bay. So large a pack indeed was not maintained
without adding greatly to our care and trouble, in supplying
them with meat and water, for it was sometimes
difficult to procure for them enough of the latter;
but, their services were invaluable, often contributing
to our safety, and always to our ease, by their constant
vigilance, as we felt confident that no danger could
approach us at night without its being announced by
their barking.</p>

<p>"No circumstances could render the value and
fidelity of these animals so conspicuous and sensible
as a journey through regions which abounding
in wild beasts of almost every class, gave us continual
opportunities of witnessing the strong contrast
between the ferocious beasts of prey, many of which
fly at the approach of man and these kind, but not always
duly appreciated, companions of the human race.
Many times when we have been travelling over plains
where the wild creatures of all kinds have fled directly
we appeared in sight, have I turned my eyes towards
my dogs, in admiration of their devotion and attachment
and have felt a grateful affection towards them
for preferring our society to the wild liberty of other
quadrupeds.</p>

<p>"Often in the middle of the night when all my
people have been fast asleep round the fire, have
I stood to contemplate these faithful animals lying by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[Pg 362]</a></span>their side, and have learned to esteem them for their
social inclination to mankind. When wandering over
pathless deserts, oppressed with vexation and distress
at the conduct of my own men I have turned to them,
as my only friends and felt how much inferior to them
was man when actuated only by selfish views.</p>

<p>"The familiarity which exists between these animals
and our own race, is so common to almost every country
of the globe, that any remark upon it must seem
superfluous, but I cannot avoid believing that it is the
universality of the fact which prevents the greater
part of mankind from duly reflecting on the subject.
While almost every other quadruped fears man as its
most formidable enemy, here is one which regards him
as a friend.</p>

<p>"We must not mistake the nature of the case, it is not
because we train him to our use and have made choice
of him in preference to other animals, but because this
particular species feels a natural desire to be useful to
man and from spontaneous impulse attaches itself to
him. Were it not so we should see in various countries
an equal familiarity with various other quadrupeds according
to the habits, tastes, or caprices of different
nations. But, everywhere, it is the dog only takes delight
in associating with us, in sharing our abodes, and
is even jealous that our attention should be bestowed
on him alone, it is he who knows us personally, watches
for us, and warns us of danger.</p>

<p>"It is impossible for the naturalist, when taking a
survey of the whole animal creation not to feel a conviction
that this friendship between two creatures so different
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[Pg 363]</a></span>from each other, must be the result of the laws
of nature; nor can the humane and feeling mind avoid
the belief that kindness to those animals, from which
he derives continued and essential assistance is part of
his moral duty." These words of such an experienced
naturalist as Mr. Burchell, are as true to-day as when
they were written by him more than fifty years ago,
but I am bound to say I think dogs are more valuable,
and more thought of now, than ever they were since
the world began.</p>

<p>Mr. Bell tells a short story of the intelligence
displayed by a Bloodhound belonging to a friend of his,
a Mr. Boyle. He says, "To make trial whether a
young hound was well instructed, Mr. Boyle desired
one of his servants to walk to a town four miles off,
and then to a market town three miles from thence.
The dog, without seeing the man he was to pursue, followed
him by the scent to the above mentioned places,
notwithstanding the multitude of market people that
went along the same road and of travellers that had occasion
to come, and when the Bloodhound came to the
market town he passed through the streets, without
taking notice of any of the people there, and ceased
not till he had gone to the house, where the man he
sought rested himself and where he found him in an
upper room to the wonder of those who had accompanied
him in this pursuit." In the face of the Bloodhound
trials last year, and again this spring, in which
my friend Mr. Brough has been so much interested, I
thought some of my readers might like to see this
short account of the doings of a young hound, more
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[Pg 364]</a></span>than half a century ago.</p>

<p>To illustrate the occasional trials of exhibitors,
I recollect starting off early with a team of dogs
for one of the first general shows held at Oxford,
I think all my dogs were in boxes or baskets
but one, a tricolour Collie, whose name I forget,
and he was on the chain, and put by the railway people
into one of those vile receptacles they call dog boxes,
narrow, dark, low and often dirty. On arrival at Didcot
(which I had before connected in my mind with
Banbury cakes, and was quite surprised to find a
"one-eyed" sort of straggling village of contemptible
size,) a porter opened one end of the dog den and
called the Collie, he, however, showed no intention of
responding to the call, and retreated to the other end
of the den and growled at the porter, and one of the
other porters went around to the further side of the
coach and opened the other door of the den, and the
dog, taking advantage of this chance of freedom,
bolted out, crossed the line, went through a hedge and
found himself at once in the open country. I had taken
no part in the affair, and declined all responsibility, but
told the officials I should sue the company for the value
of the dog, lost through their carelessness. They
begged me to accompany some of their men in search
of the dog, as he might be easier caught if he saw
someone he knew amongst those after him.</p>

<p>Soon after it began to rain, and from soon after
eleven a. m. till after six p. m. we tramped the country
in search of the wandering dog, whom we afterwards
saw in the distance, but in that district the fields are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[Pg 365]</a></span>very large, and often as we laboriously got into a field
through a hedge or over hurdles, etc., we had the
mortification of seeing the dog disappear through or
over the hedge on the opposite side, and very wearisome
work it was.</p>

<p>At length I decided to go on to Oxford, with
the rest of my dogs, and left the matter of the
lost dog with the railway company, who, I was
informed, offered a reward for his recovery, and
about a month afterwards I had a letter asking
me to call at one of their stations where they
thought a dog lately found answered the description
of mine. This turned out to be correct and I took
home the dog, making a small claim for expenses I had
been put to in the matter. The dog was not in bad condition,
and still wore the collar and chain on him when
lost, but it is strange how that dog managed to live for
a month in such a sparsely inhabited district as that
round about Didcot, at any rate at that time, which is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[Pg 366]</a></span>about fifteen years ago.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Anecdotes About Dogs</span> (<i>Continued</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">I have</span> been asked to reproduce a humourous "skit,"
which appeared in "The Daily Mail" 9th of July,
1897, from the pen of a well-known contributor to that
paper. It was headed "A Ladies' Dog Show," and ran
as follows: "Seven gentle ladies were yesterday to be
observed walking gravely in a circle in Regents Park.
They each led a Black Pug by a chain. They walked
round and round a ruddy old gentleman with keen blue
eyes, a shepherd's smock, and a slouched straw hat.
Three partridge feathers stuck out jauntily from the
side of the hat. The ladies cast appealing looks at the
shepherd, who stared hard at the insignificant little
wretches of dogs, one of whom barked all the while,
but he did not heed it. The march became quicker; the
ladies looked more appealing than ever. A crowd gathered
around and observed the strange proceedings with
wonder. What was it? they asked. A new system of
Pantheistic worship? or a side show from a menagerie?
The shepherd put up his hand and the ladies
stopped, dead. He threw down his glittering pencil to
attract the notice of one of the glossy little Pugs. The
Pug snapped. He caught it by the head, and stared
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[Pg 367]</a></span>hard in its ridiculous little face. The dog chastened by
the keen blue eyes, ceased to yelp. The proud proprietor
at the other end of the chain, looked as anxious as
a criminal in the dock. The other ladies made the most
of this moment of respite. They patted their dogs and
kissed them, and told them to be good little duckies of
doggies, and mamma would be so pleased! One
tempted her charge with a biscuit, another with half a
crown. The coin was held up above the dog's nose.
Doggie jumped, and scrambled and yelped just like
any of its human acquaintances. The shepherd looked
at each dog in turn, and wrote something in a book,
and then seven ladies and seven dogs left the ring. One
lady looked pleased, another fairly satisfied and the
rest as if somebody had blundered. The Pugs were all
indifferent. But the secret was out, there were no mysterious
rites of an Esoteric creed. It was a dog show,
that of the 'Ladies' Kennel Association.' They have
survived their internecine troubles, and have more
members than they had before that dramatic split at the
Holborn restaurant and boast of more entries at this
show than ever they had before. Between seven hundred
and eight hundred dogs are staged. At a Ladies'
Show it is to be expected that some of the conventionalities
will be overthrown. There are, for instance, no
men prowling about, with cloth caps, buckskin leggings,
and wisps of straw, telling you that their Terrier
killed fifty rats in thirty seconds or that 'the Brindled
Bull was own sister to the best dawg that was ever
bred.' The exhibitors are ladies, elegantly dressed, who
sit and listen to the band with their Pugs and Spaniels,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[Pg 368]</a></span>on their knees. It is the same with the dogs, there are
no sporting dogs, to speak of, though the number is increasing
year by year and not half a score of Bull Dogs.
Such as there are, a little aristocracy of bone and jowl
lie at rest in a distant corner of the tent not deigning to
notice the Poodles around. Near them are a few Airedale
Terriers. One of them, which would be in its element
in a rattling street fight, stretched to the top of its
pen, looked over at the 'curled darlings' on the other
side, deliberately yawned and turned over again to sleep.
There is a whole tent full of Toy Spaniels and other
exquisites in upholstered pens. They have ribbons
round their necks, and bells and go about two to the
pound. The Poodles are curled and shaven and shorn,
and decked out with top-knots of coloured ribbons.
One which lay asleep was described as a 'Rag and a
Bone, and a Hank of Worsted,' Two Poodle puppies,
not yet shorn, looked refreshingly unkempt by the side
of these ultra-respectable Uncles and Aunts. A litter of
Dachshunds resembled lion cubs asleep. The foreign
class which is both strong and varied, provided an
amusing contrast. In one pen was a huge shaggy
'Balu,' in the next a shivering little 'Mousie Chihuahua,'
whatever that may be! 'Balu' could have
taken 'Mousie' among his hors d'&oelig;uvres before dinner.
Chows with big heads and wee twinkling eyes.
Borzois trying to twist their legs into geometrical figures;
an Esquimo asleep; a vicious Dingo in a cage.
St. Bernards which made the tent quiver, when they
barked and Bloodhounds sleeping serenely, there being
no murderers about, these were the Giants of the show.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[Pg 369]</a></span>If not as numerous, certainly they were a more weighty
section than the Toy Spaniels. The Princess of Wales
was among the exhibitors. If anyone wants to see a
good collection of 'Japs' and 'Poms' and 'Skyes'
and 'Dachs' and 'Charlies,' so the ladies tenderly
call them, at Regents Park, he will find
them."</p>

<p>The following related by the late Hon. Grantley
Berkeley, strongly illustrative of the sagacity and
thinking powers of dogs, may be interesting to some of
my readers: "I had a dog called 'Wolf,' at Teffont
Mane House, in Wiltshire, and when I fed my tame
pheasants and partridges I always took him with me.
This dog had seen my caution when I approached the
birds and always obeyed my signal to lie down by the
gun till I had done feeding them. When the game began
to get to an age to stray, a considerable number
used to come upon the lawn in front of the windows.</p>

<p>"One afternoon the lawn being, to all appearances,
clear of birds, I sent Wolf to hunt a rabbit out of a circular
flower bed, for me to shoot. The dog obeyed the
sign, but no sooner had he entered the laurels, than he
made a sort of snap with his jaws, a thing he always
did when he was not pleased, and returned to my heels
with rather a sheepish look. The sign to hunt having
been repeated the same thing occurred and on his returning
to me with a peculiar expression in his face, I
went to the laurels to ascertain what hindered his obedience.</p>

<p>"To my great pleasure I found about a dozen young
pheasants, into whose presence he was fearful of intruding,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[Pg 370]</a></span>so I lay down on the lawn close to the pheasants, and letting him see how pleased I was, caressed
him for full five minutes, and then when I retired, did
so in a most marked and stealthy manner, which he,
close at my heels, immediately adopted. Now suppose
some thoughtless or inconsiderate master with such a
dog as this had upon his refusal to hunt, beaten or
kicked him for disobedience, which would really have
deserved the punishment, the sensible dog, or the silly
man?</p>

<p>"On taking up my residence at Beacon Lodge,
and, for years after, Wolf was still in or out of the
house, my constant companion and closely observant of
all I did or desired. When first the wild white rabbits
began to appear at Beacon, I never shot them, but very
frequently killed the brown ones by their side. In
hunting any outlying place, if by chance there was a
white rabbit, I used to stop Wolf from hunting it up
to my gun, and by observation the dog convinced himself
that a rabbit so coloured was on no account to be
molested. When the whites had become more common,
one evening I went out to kill some rabbits for the table,
or to give away, and seeing a very fine young white
one, I shot it. The rabbit lay dead on the contrary
side of a fence, and Wolf had not seen it killed, but at a
sign from me, flew over to pick up whatever might be
there. The rabbit lay kicking with its hinder legs, and
Wolf seeing the motion in the grass, dashed up, but instantly
made the snap with his jaws, dropped his stern
and came back with a sheepish look, as if to tell me I
had done wrong. I praised and made much of him,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[Pg 371]</a></span>and taking him with me up to the rabbit encouraged
him to pick it up and to give it to me, and ever after he
would pick up any coloured rabbit that might be killed.</p>

<p>"Wolf's dinner hour was at my dessert time, the last
thing the retiring servants had to do was to place his
plate upon the hearthrug. Occasionally they neglected
to do this, and then he had seen me ring the bell, to
rectify the omission. For some years before his death,
when his dinner was due, and had not been brought in,
after looking at me with a wistful expression of countenance,
he would go up and kiss the bell handle, and
then come to me, look up in my face, and push my arm
with his nose. Of course, up came his dinner, with a
ring from the bell, denoting double quick time."</p>

<p>More than forty years since, there was a London
street dog which took a great fancy to following
the fire engines. Whenever there was a
fire there would the dog be seen running in and
out among the throng apparently making himself
as busy as possible. This strange conduct of the
animal, of course, attracted the attention of the
firemen, and after a time they used to feed and take notice
of him, occasionally giving him a ride on the engine.
At last, so well was the dog known that he came
to be called the Fireman's Dog. He owned no master,
but stopped a day or two with any of the firemen he
took a fancy to. He was always on the alert, directly
the fire alarm was given, and used frequently to run by
the side of the horses for miles together. At last the
dog on one of the journeys, was run over and killed,
when the firemen had his body stuffed and set up in a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[Pg 372]</a></span>glass case in the principal office of the Metropolitan
fire brigade, Watling street, London. There it remained
for some years, and numbers of people called to
see him in his glass case.</p>

<p>In 1853 the Superintendent of the Fire Station,
Chandos street, Covent Garden, was for some neglect
of duty degraded to the rank of an ordinary fireman.
This disgrace so preyed on the poor fellow's
mind, that one winter's night he threw himself
over Waterloo Bridge and was drowned. He left
a widow and children totally unprovided for, and
in order to procure a sum for their relief, the glass case
containing the stuffed figure of the Fireman's Dog
was disposed of by way of lottery. A raffle took place
at a tavern in Chandos street, when upwards of a hundred
pounds was realised. The dog was won by the
tavern-keeper, and in his parlour it may still be seen.
Thus you see that long after death the dog has been
found useful to his masters in time of need.</p>

<p>The following account of a dog, for many years
known as "The Brighton Coach Dog," is cut from an
old newspaper of the time. "For a long period a dog
invariably accompanied the only coach which in 1851
ran between London and Brighton. On the 24th June,
in that year, he was placed on the back of the coach to
prevent his barking at the horses, when he jumped off
at Henfield and fell between the wheels, one of which,
passing over his back, killed him. The animal belonged
to an ostler at the Newcastle Place stables, Edgeware
Road, London; he went to the yard when a puppy and
the man took care of him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[Pg 373]</a></span>"Being brought up amongst horses, he was never
happy unless with them at home, or travelling about.
His chief delight was to travel up and down with the
Brighton coach. He had been known to travel, during
the last spring of his life, for eight successive days to
and from Brighton, Sundays intervening.</p>

<p>"The distance from London to Brighton by way
of Leatherhead, Dorking, Horsham and Henfield,
the road which the stage coach traversed is seventy-four
miles. It was with great difficulty he could
be kept on the coach, always preferring to run by the
side of it and it was his being placed on the top of the
coach, from feelings of humanity on the part of Clarke,
the coachman, which cost him his life.</p>

<p>"On one occasion the guard placed him inside the
coach, when there were no passengers, but in a few
minutes he was surprised to see him running beside the
coach, having jumped clean through the glass window.</p>

<p>"During the early part of the summer he went with
a strange coach to Tunbridge Wells, not liking his berth
he did not return to London by the same conveyance,
but found his way across the country from Tunbridge
Wells to Brighton and went up to London with his
favourite team.</p>

<p>"He was well known by many on the road from
London to Brighton, and in some places on the journey
met with hospitable treatment. At the time of his
death he was about five years old. Clarke informed us
that he would kill a goose on his travels by the roadside,
throw it over his back like a fox, and run for
miles, and he offered to lay a wager that the dog would
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[Pg 374]</a></span>accompany the coach between Brighton and London
daily for a month, Sundays excepted, and kill a goose
by the roadside each day of his travels, provided birds
were put within his reach. His skin was preserved, and
has been stuffed. The 'Brighton Coach Dog' may be
seen in the attitude of life in the bar parlour of a tavern
in the Edgeware Road."</p>

<p>I do not think I mentioned, when speaking of
my kennels, and dogs, that for many years, an
old Great Western Railway coach formed part of
them, it was composed of a first-class, second-class,
third-class compartments, and a luggage van, as
a general rule, we had a pair of dogs, male and female,
in each division, and used the luggage van for biscuits.</p>

<p>As some of my readers may like to try the same experiment,
I may say that there is no difficulty in the
way, there are usually railway coaches of different
sizes (I believe, you can also purchase horse boxes
and trucks, which often serve the purpose of cow and
poultry and cart and trap sheds) for sale at Swindon,
where I bought mine for five pounds.</p>

<p>Of course, it was merely the body, without any
of the iron under part, but with the windows, doors,
seats, ventilators, etc., no cushions or upholstery
of any kind, but the only expense I had to incur
was to get the village smith to fix some small
iron bars on the outside of each window frame,
to enable us to open the windows to give plenty
of air, without the fear of the inmates getting out. The
company delivered free to their nearest station, which
in my case was within two miles from my place, and I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[Pg 375]</a></span>there had a trolly and pair of horses, and the coach run
on to it and lashed firmly to the trolly and it was
brought without much difficulty as the weight was
only about thirty-five hundredweight, although it
looked a heavy affair.</p>

<p>There was more time and trouble in fixing it
in its place in my yard, than in the journey there.
And some years afterwards when I changed my
residence, I got the village smith to fix an axle
and a couple of low strong wheels at each end of
the coach, and one of the neighbouring farmers easily
took it along the road to my new dwelling place, with a
couple of his cart horses, to the great amusement and
delight of the rural population, who insisted that each
of the divisions was filled with some of my dogs, which
were well known in the district as being frequent prize
winners.</p>

<p>The following is related on the authority of an
old newspaper called the "Boston Traveller," published
in the United States of America: A gentleman
stopping at an hotel in Boston, privately hid his pocket
handkerchief behind the sofa cushion in the coffee
room and left the hotel accompanied by his dog, after
walking for some distance, he suddenly stopped and
said to his dog, "I have left my handkerchief at the
hotel, go back and fetch it for me," giving no particular
directions about it. The dog immediately returned
at full speed, and entered the room his master had just
left. He went directly to the sofa, but the handkerchief
was gone. He jumped upon tables and counters,
but it was nowhere to be seen. It turned out that a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[Pg 376]</a></span>friend of his master's had discovered it and supposing
it had been left by mistake, had taken care of it for the
owner. But "Tiger" was not to be foiled. He flew
about the room, apparently much excited, in quest of
the "lost or stolen." Soon, however, he was upon the
track, he scented it to the gentleman's coat pocket.
What was to be done? The dog had no means of asking
for it, by word of mouth, and was not accustomed
to picking pockets, and besides the gentleman was ignorant
of his business with him. But Tiger's sagacity
did not suffer him to remain long in suspense. He
seized the skirt containing the prize and furiously tearing
it from the coat, hastily made off with it, much to
the surprise of the owner. Tiger then overtook his master,
and restored the lost property. Both the owner of
the dog and the gentleman who had lost the tail of his
coat, applauded the dog for his sagacity.</p>

<p>In the southeast window of St. Mary's church, Lambeth,
there is the full length figure of a pedlar with his
pack, his staff and dog. This is the portrait of the unknown
man who gave "Pedlar's Acre" to the parish of
Lambeth. The story is worth telling. In the year 1504,
a poor pedlar passing over a piece of waste ground
near the river sat down to rest on the trunk of a tree.
While seated here, he noticed that his dog acted very
strangely, busying himself with scratching the earth
with his feet and barking, and smelling about, every
now and then running up to his master and looking
him earnestly in the face and trying to drag him from
his seat. The pedlar did not at first pay much attention
to the dog, but its repeated barking and running
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[Pg 377]</a></span>to and fro compelled him, at last, to see what the animal wanted. Going to where the dog had been scratching
he was surprised to find something shining below.
Digging on the spot he discovered a large sum of
money with part of which he purchased the land originally
known as Pedlar's Acre, but now called the Belvidere
Road, in Lambeth.</p>

<p>Maitland, the historian of London, (1739 edition,
page 791) tells the story as I have given it with the
addition that the pedlar left the piece of land to the
parish on condition that his portrait and that of his dog
should be perpetually preserved in painted glass in
one of the windows of the church. I cannot say
whether this be true or not, but such is the legend, and
there is the painted window with the portrait of the
man and dog, as evidence still remaining.</p>

<p>The following story about a Mastiff appeared
in the Glasgow Chronicle: Early one Sunday morning
some thieves attempted to enter the premises
of Messrs. McLeod and Pollock, Argyle street, Glasgow,
jewellers, by breaking through the sky-light. The
building was one story high and it was comparatively
easy to get on to the roof. About two o'clock a. m.
Mr. McLeod, who resided in the back of the premises,
was awakened by the action of his watch dog. The animal
did not bark, but jumped upon the bed and continued
scratching with his forepaws until his master
rose up. The dog then uttered a low growl and looked
towards the roof, as if anxious to draw his master's attention
to that particular quarter. Immediately afterwards
a small piece of glass fell on the floor, and on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[Pg 378]</a></span>Mr. McLeod looking up he could see a man furtively
moving on the roof; the police were informed and effected
an arrest of the intruding burglar, through the
warning given by the dog and before he had time to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[Pg 379]</a></span>conceal himself or make good his retreat.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Anecdotes About Dogs</span> (<i>Continued</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> Mr. St. John's "Highland Sports," there is the
following characteristic anecdote of a shepherd's dog:
"A shepherd, a neighbour of mine, to prove the quickness
of his dog, who was lying before the fire in the
farmhouse kitchen where we were talking, one day,
said to me in the middle of a conversation about quite
a different matter, 'I'm thinking, sir, the cow's got
into the potatoes,' though he purposely laid no stress
on these words, and said them in a quiet, unconcerned
tone of voice, the dog, who appeared to be asleep, immediately
jumped up, leaped through the open window
and scrambled up the turf roof of the house, from
which he could see the potato field. Not seeing her
there, he then ran into the farm yard, and finding her
there, all right, came back to the house. After a time
the shepherd said the same words again, and the dog
repeated his look out, but on the false alarm being
given a third time, the dog got up and wagging his
tail, looked his master full in the face with such a
comical expression of inquiry, that we could not refrain
from laughing heartily, on which with a slight growl
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[Pg 380]</a></span>he laid himself down again to sleep in his accustomed
place on the hearth rug, with an offended air, as if determined
not to be made a fool of again."</p>

<p>Most people who know anything about dogs, or
doggy people, know Mr. George Raper, one of
the most popular and capable all-round judges we
have, but they do not all know what a very lively and
active man he is. In my long experience as an
exhibitor, I have often found myself in his company
in different parts of the country, and usually he
has had some good story to tell, or amusing thing
to do. I remember, on one occasion, when we and a
number more were staying at an hotel in South Wales,
I forget now whether it was Haverfordwest, Pembroke
or Tenby, but I think it was one of those
three, how he astonished an old gentleman (not the
least doggy or sporting in his appearance), by his
agility. We were talking in the bar parlour of the
hotel about vaulting, and in the room there was the
ordinary high and wide pewter covered counter, or
bar. I said, "I suppose you would not attempt to
negotiate such an article as that?" Mr. Raper said,
"I should have a good try at it," and without saying
more, he stepped back, placed his hand on the centre
of the counter, vaulted over, and then vaulted back
again; the old gentleman, who was sitting down
quietly having some refreshment, jumped up and said,
"Bless my heart and soul, sir, I never saw such a thing
done in my life!" which made us all laugh heartily.</p>

<p>Captain Brown, in his "Popular Natural History,"
tells the following story of those formerly much to be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[Pg 381]</a></span>pitied animals, the dogs utilized as "Turnspits."
"The Duke de Leancourt had for the work in his
kitchen two Turnspits, which took their turns, regularly,
every other day in the wheel (something after
the style of the revolving cages for squirrels and
mice). One of them not liking his employment, hid
himself on the day it was his turn to work, when they
tried to force his companion to mount the wheel in his
stead, he cried, and wagging his tail, intimated to those
in authority to follow him. He at once conducted
them to an upstairs lumber room, where he dislodged
the idle dog, and gave him a good thrashing on the
spot."</p>

<p>In Mr. Baker's "Rifle and Hound in Ceylon,"
he says: "I was once shooting at Illepecadewè, which
is a lonely, miserable spot, when I met with a very
sagacious and independent sportsman in a most unexpected
manner. I was shooting with a friend and we
had separated for a few hundred paces. Presently I
came upon a lot of Pea fowl and killed one of them
with my rifle. The shot was no sooner fired than I
heard another shot in the jungle, in the direction taken
by my friend. My rifle was still unloaded when a
spotted doe bounded out of the jungle, followed by a
white Pariah dog in full chase. Who would have
dreamt of meeting with a dog at a distance of more
than three or four miles from any houses! I whistled
to the dog, and to my surprise he came to me, the deer
having, meanwhile, run clean out of sight in an incredibly
short space of time. He was a knowing looking
brute, and evidently out hunting on his own account.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[Pg 382]</a></span>Just at this moment, my friend called out to me that he
had wounded a buck, and had found the blood-stained
track. I picked a blade of grass from the spot, which
was tinged with blood, and holding it to the dog's nose,
he eagerly followed me to the track, upon which I
dropped it.</p>

<p>"He went off in a moment, but running mute
I was obliged to follow, and after a run of over
half a mile, I lost sight of him. In following the track
of the wounded buck I heard the distant barking of a
dog, by which I knew he had brought him to bay, and
I was soon at the spot. The buck had taken up a position
in a small glade, and was charging furiously at
the dog, but he was a great deal too knowing to court
the danger and kept well out of the way. I shot the
buck, and tying a piece of jungle rope to the dog's neck,
gave him to a gunbearer to lead as I hoped he might be
again useful in hunting up a wounded deer. I had not
proceeded more than half a mile when we arrived at
the edge of a small sluggish stream, covered in most
places with rushes and waterlilies.</p>

<p>"We waded through this about up to our hips, but
the gunbearer, who had the dog with him, could
not prevail upon our mute companion to follow;
he pulled violently back and shrank and showed
every sign of terror as he approached the water.
I had now got over and was on the opposite
bank, but as nothing could induce the dog to voluntarily
come near the river, I told the gunbearer to
drag him across by force. This he accordingly did,
and the dog swam with frantic exertions across the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[Pg 383]</a></span>river and managed to slip his head out of the jungle
rope by which he was held. The moment he arrived
on terra firma, he rushed up a steep bank and looked attentively
down into the water beneath. We now gave
him credit for his sagacity in refusing to cross the
dangerous passage.</p>

<p>"The reeds bowed down to the right and left as
a huge crocodile of about eighteen feet in length
moved slowly from his shallow bed into a deep
hole. The dog turned to the right about and ran
off as fast as his legs would carry him. No calling
or whistling would induce him to return and I never
saw him again. How he knew that a large crocodile
lay concealed in the river I do not know, he probably
had a previous unpleasant experience of those creatures,
and seemed determined to profit by the lesson he
had learnt. Making use of the experience I had gained
in wild sports in the country, I came out well armed,
according to my ideas of weapons for the chase. I had
four double-barrelled rifles made specially to my order
and my own pattern, my hunting knives and boar spear
heads were also made to my own design and I arrived
in Ceylon with a fine pack of Foxhounds, and 'Bran,'
a favourite greyhound of wonderful speed and
strength. The usual drawbacks and discomforts attending
upon a new settlement having been overcome,
Newera Ellia formed a pleasant place of residence. I
soon, however, discovered that Foxhounds were not at
all adapted to a country so enclosed by forest, some of
the hounds were lost, others I parted with, and their
progeny, crossed with Pointers, Bloodhounds and other
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[Pg 384]</a></span>breeds, have proved a useful stamp for Elk hunting.</p>

<p>"It is difficult to form a pack for this sport which
shall be perfect in all respects. Sometimes a splendid
hound in character may be more like a butcher's dog in
appearance, but the pack cannot afford to part with him
if he has really proved his value in work. The casualties
from Leopards, Wild Boars, Elks and lost dogs
are so great that the pack is with extreme difficulty
kept up by breeding.</p>

<p>"It must be borne in mind that the place of a lost
dog cannot be easily supplied in Ceylon! Newera
Ellia is one of the few places in the island where
the climate is suited to the constitution of a dog.
In the low and hot climates they lead a short and
miserable life, which is soon ended by the inevitable
liver complaint; thus, if a supply for the pack
cannot be kept up by breeding, hounds must be procured
from England from time to time, and this, it is
needless to say, is attended with much risk and great
expense."</p>

<p>On one of the last occasions I exhibited my dogs
at Maidstone show, in Kent, I was rather amused
by a conversation I had with the secretary there. He
said, "whenever I see you, sir, I think of your Dog."
I asked what dog he referred to? He said, "one of
your Dandies, I think he was a champion, (I forget
whether it was Champion Rob Roy, or Champion
Laird, but think it must have been the former). You
had to leave before the end of the show, which was
very unusual with you, sir, and you asked me to see
your dogs packed; I was out in the building where all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[Pg 385]</a></span>the boxes and baskets were, when I heard a crackling
noise, and, looking towards the place, saw a dog's
head, and directly afterwards his body, come out of
one of the hampers, and saw the dog walk across the
building, and search amongst the packages, when he
had found the one he wanted, he lifted up the lid with
his nose, jumped in and lay down; I at once went over
to see what name and number was on the package, and
found that one of your dogs had been put, by an oversight,
into a wrong basket, and as he found out it was
not the proper one, he ate his way out, searched for and
found his correct travelling basket, and lay down in it,
ready to be sent home. I thought this was so smart and
intelligent of the dog that I have never forgotten it, and
have often mentioned it to my friends, who are interested
in dogs."</p>

<p>The following about the dog, which appeared in
the "Arcana of Science" in 1829, just seventy
years ago, may be interesting to some of my readers
at the present day: "The dog is the only animal
that dreams, he and the elephant the only animals that
understand looks and expressions; the elephant is the
only four-footed animal that feels ennui; the dog the
only quadruped which has been brought to speak.
Professor Leibnitz, in Saxony, bore witness to a hound,
he had heard speak thirty words distinctly."</p>

<p>I am inclined to doubt the speaking faculty of the
dog, though I have certainly seen many animals that
could do almost everything, <i>but</i> speak.</p>

<p>Buffon, the eminent French naturalist, says of
the dog, "More docile than man, more obedient
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[Pg 386]</a></span>than any other animal, he is not only instructed
in a short time, but also conforms to the manners
and dispositions of those who have authority
over him. He takes his tone from the house he
inhabits, like the rest of the domestic staff, he is disdainful
among the great and churlish among the
clowns. Always assiduous in serving his master, and
only friendly to his friends; he is indifferent to all others
and declares himself openly against such as are dependent
like himself. He knows a beggar by his voice,
by his clothes or his gestures and challenges his approach.
When, at night, or other occasions, the protection
of the house is entrusted to his care, he seems
proud of the charge, he continues a vigilant sentinel,
he goes his rounds, scents strangers at a distance and
gives them warning he is upon duty. If they attempt
to break in upon his territory, he becomes more fierce,
flies at them, threatens, fights, and either conquers
alone or alarms those who have most at interest in
coming to his assistance, however, when he has conquered,
he quickly reposes, and abstains from what he
has prevented others from abusing, giving thus, at
once, a lesson of courage, temperance and fidelity."</p>

<p>I think it was in May, 1881, I sustained one of my
severest losses in connection with dogs. I was at
that time owner of a very well-known and high class,
all white, medium-sized Bull Bitch, which I called
"Lady Rozelle" (her portrait appears in one of
the illustrations to this book, as well as that of
my Smooth Collie Bitch, "Lady Nellie," even more
celebrated in her own line) and had taken a great
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[Pg 387]</a></span>number of prizes at all the leading shows. I was
anxious to take just one more, the gold medal of
the Bull Dog Club. She had already taken both the
bronze and silver medals, and I then intended her to
rest on her laurels, as I have always endeavoured to let
any of my great prize winners end their days in peace
and comfort, free from the fatigue and excitement of
shows and never like to see animals which have done
good service for their owners, hacked about in Variety
and Selling classes, all over the country. The weather
when I travelled to Aldridge's, St. Martin's Lane,
where the Bull Dog Club's show was to be held, was
very warm and sultry, and on arrival at Paddington, I
had her box put on the roof of a cab and run over to the
show, but on its being opened there, as it happened, by
my old friend, Mr. J. W. Berrie, then, as now, the
president of the Bull Dog Club, I think everyone present
was horrified to find my beautiful bitch actually
stone dead, and from the appearance of the body,
should think the heat must have brought on an apoplectic
seizure and death must have been very sudden. Of
course, as is usual in such cases, I had someone at the
time anxious to purchase her at, what was then
thought, a very long price, £250.</p>

<p>Dogs have played important parts in the superstitions
of ages now happily passed away. When the dog
howled at the gate, it used to be alleged that one
of the family was to die. Old women suspected
of being witches because they were infirm and
stricken with poverty were supposed to always have
either a cat or dog, said to be their "Familiar"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[Pg 388]</a></span>and through whom they could be enabled to commune with the Spirit of Darkness. To meet a
black dog on a dark or stormy night was deemed a very
unlucky sign; dogs were said to be possessed by evil
spirits, and to haunt the wicked and in more than one
story the evil one himself has been stated to have taken
the form of the faithful friend and companion of man.
I will conclude these anecdotes about dogs with the
following excellent advice given by the late well-known
sportsman, the Hon. Grantley Berkeley, in the pages
of "The Field," more than forty years since: "Before
you chastise a dog, be not only sure that he is in fault,
but also ascertain that he himself understands in what
respect he has done wrong. Take care not to punish
him so severely that terror and pain combined obliterate
the why and the wherefore from the sufferer's recollection,
if you do, you cowe the dog, without amending
his manners. To teach tricks to dogs, (in the general
way, and, unless they are dogs belonging to those
whose living is to be earned by the employment of performing
dogs,) either with cards, numbers, or letters,
is infinitely beneath a sportsman, as well as insulting to
the useful and thinking capabilities of the canine
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[Pg 389]</a></span>race!"</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIV" id="CHAPTER_XXIV"></a>CHAPTER XXIV</h2>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">A Few Words About General Management and
Some Simple Maladies, to Which Dogs are Subject,
and Their Treatment</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">These</span> few practical directions and suggestions are
not intended to take the place of the veterinary surgeon,
whose skill and experience are often of the greatest
value in dealing with cases of a serious nature, but
just to give inexperienced persons some idea what to
do, in case of emergency; as, in all cases of illness or
accidents to animals, immediate treatment is often
most important.</p>

<p>I may say that a "bond of sympathy" should exist
between an owner or keeper, and his dogs, and
when this is the case, it will be much easier to deal with
them, either in health or sickness, but <i>particularly</i> the
latter.</p>

<p>I believe more trouble is caused by mismanagement
than any other cause, and that if only proper attention
be paid to the three cardinal points of "cleanliness, food
and exercise," there will not be much the matter with
the inmates of the kennel.</p>

<p>I have, for a great number of years, kept a small
lot of dogs, varying in number from fifteen to fifty, but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[Pg 390]</a></span>although <i>accidents</i> will be constantly occurring with
live stock of all kinds, I have had wonderfully little illness,
amongst my dogs, except the ordinary ailments
so generally expected, and I attribute this mainly to
endeavouring to enforce cleanliness and plenty of exercise,
and providing food varying in character and
quantity to suit the appetites of the inmates.</p>

<p>I may say, while on the subject of food, that although
in winter, or very cold weather, it is well it
should be given "with the chill off," it is better not
to let it be warm, in a general way, as it is thought unnatural
for dogs, and tends to weaken their digestive
powers.</p>

<p>Also except in cases of packs of hounds, where it
is unavoidable, (but they are generally accompanied by
some of the kennel men, and attendants to avoid undue
"differences of opinion,") it is best, <i>not</i> to feed
two or more dogs together, as often the stronger member
will overpower the weaker, and perhaps consume
more than his or her share; you will notice this, even
amongst puppies.</p>

<p>An owner, or keeper will soon get to know the right
amount to give each, and give just as much as will be
finished <i>at the time</i>, when the pan should be removed,
or washed out, and filled with water, if benched alone,
not otherwise, or it may be upset in the course of
play, etc.</p>

<p>Except in cases of bitches with families or puppies
by themselves when two or more meals may be given,
it is usual to feed once a day either morning or evening
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[Pg 391]</a></span>as most convenient, giving each as much as they
will eat, with appetite, the oftener varied the better, as
I said in the "Introduction."</p>

<p>Unless any difficulty occurs, at the birth of the
puppies, when skilled assistance should be obtained,
the less the bitch is disturbed the better, but a few
days afterwards it is well to examine the litter,
and destroy any deformed or faulty ones, and if she
has more than she can reasonably bring up, to put some
of them under a "foster mother," which are frequently
advertised in the papers dealing with dogs and doggy
matters, if not procurable in your own district, in such
case, it is best not to take away all the foster litter at
once, but introduce the new-comers (in the absence of
the "Foster,") amongst her remaining puppies, and
mix them up, together, so that they will <i>smell alike</i>,
and gradually weed out those not desired to be kept.</p>

<p>After three weeks old, the puppies should be given
bread and milk, which will help the mothers in their
nursing, and about this time if a breed which requires
their tails to be shortened, a part may be taken off, with
a strong pair of scissors, not too sharp, feeling for a
joint, before making the cut, and if carefully done, it
causes but momentary pain, and soon heals up.</p>

<p>At six weeks old, they may be removed from the
mother, altogether, and if she seems at all troubled
with milk, occasionally squeeze out any milk, with the
finger and thumb, and dress the teats with vinegar and
water, which generally prevents swelling or inflammation,
and helps to dry off the milk.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[Pg 392]</a></span>I need not say that the stories sometimes heard
about dogs having a "worm under the tongue," which
must be taken out, are <i>all humbug</i>, and should not be
credited.</p>

<p>Sometimes dogs' claws, when not sufficiently exercised,
grow too long and require to be shortened, but
this is easily done with a sharp pair of "nippers."</p>

<p>Putting a piece of stone sulphur in the water
is <i>no good</i>, as being a mineral, it does not dissolve,
and you might just as well put a lump of
coal in! But, as I said before, a little "Flowers of
Brimstone," according to the size of the animal, either
mixed in milk, or with its food, is beneficial and has a
cooling effect, and I sometimes add a small quantity of
magnesia, with the same object.</p>

<p>Above everything, see that the place where the dog
lives is dry, warm in winter and free from draughts.</p>

<p>I think dogs kept in a house as pets are more liable
to disease, than those kept in kennels, from often having
no regular meals or rules, but constantly being fed
by many people, and so getting more than they require
of food, but much less of exercise.</p>

<p>Chicken and game bones are not desirable for
dogs, as they break into sharp splinters which when
swallowed may cause injury to the intestines, but other
bones are occasionally very good for dogs, and much
enjoyed by them; and when at liberty they will take
grass, which, as with cats, is very useful for their digestion.</p>

<p>Most dogs are troubled with fleas, and some with
ticks and other small insects, particularly in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[Pg 393]</a></span>summer. I have found an occasional washing, with a
weak solution of "Jeye's Purifier," (procurable of
any chemist, or stores, with full directions on the bottles),
makes a great improvement in this respect, and
if the breed of the animal is small, or it is one kept indoors,
it may have an occasional combing with a small
tooth comb, having a basin of boiling water at hand,
to put the "results" in.</p>

<p>In all treatment of a sick dog, <i>remember</i> you
are dealing with a highly sensitive and nervous
patient, be very gentle, avoid roughness, or anything
likely to alarm him; in giving any liquid
medicine, <i>do not open his mouth</i>, but placing him between
your knees with his face looking in same direction
as your own, gently raise his jaw, and pulling his
lips away from his teeth, on one side of his mouth, to
form a cup, or funnel, very slowly pour from bottle or
spoon, the quantity he is to have, into it. Keep his head
raised for a minute or two, and if he does not swallow
the dose, insert a spoon between his front teeth, this
will have the effect of drawing off his attention from
the medicine, and he will, usually, swallow at once. If
the dose is a pill, bolus, or anything solid, hold his head
the same way as before mentioned, but with the left
hand under lower jaw, press firmly on each side with
thumb and finger at the junction of upper and lower
jaws. This will usually cause him to open his
mouth, when the dose should be put into the mouth, as
far back as possible, <i>over the tongue</i> (or he will spit it
out) and close the jaws somewhat sharply, and in most
cases the deed is done. If any trouble arises with the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[Pg 394]</a></span>action of his front paws, this may be got over by wrapping him round with a shawl, or coarse apron. When
once you have got into the way of it, you will be surprised
how simple it is. I am quite sure a practised
owner or kennelsman, would dose a dozen dogs, while
a novice was making a bungle over one!</p>

<p><i>Distemper</i> carries off scores of dogs every year,
but it is quite a mistake to suppose all dogs <i>must</i> have
it. I have had, probably, more without than with
it, the worst of it is that it varies so in different
cases, so that the same treatment does not
do for all; sometimes the brain, at others, the
stomach, at others, the lungs, are most affected;
it is of an inflammatory and very debilitating character,
and frequently accompanied by severe convulsions
and fits, which are very alarming and distressing.
Generally, there is discharge from nose and eyes,
but <i>not</i> invariably. I am doubtful if there is any positive
and unfailing cure for the complaint, although so
many claim to be, so much depends on the form the
disease takes, the treatment given, and the constitution
of the patient. The symptoms comprise great depression,
debility, want of life and appetite, and great languor;
as medicine, two or three grains of calomel in
milk may be given; if possible, get the patient to drink
it which he sometimes will, being feverish from the
nature of the disease; sometimes a small dose of
"James's Powders," administered in same way, has a
good effect. For food, anything light and nourishing,
such as thickish gruel, or good broth, or bovril, may be
given. The old adage, that prevention is better than
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[Pg 395]</a></span>cure holds good here, and young dogs not fed too
highly, and occasionally dosed with Epsom salts or
jalap, when their bowels are out of order, or their eyes
look unnatural, not given much meat while young, and
kept from going into the water at too early an age,
will often ward off this scourge of the race.</p>

<p>Dogs are sometimes troubled with <i>Skin affections</i>
such as mange and eczema, both are thought to
have their origin in errors in feeding and particularly
in the former, from want of due attention to
cleanliness. I have found the following, which
we have always kept ready for use, to apply a
little if required, a certain cure, if persevered with.
Equal quantities of train oil and paraffin and a
tablespoonful of black sulphur to each quart of the
mixture applied freely to the affected parts, every other
day with a piece of sponge. If the attack is very slight,
a little sulphur ointment made by mixing sufficient
Flowers of Sulphur, with hog's lard, to make a fairly
firm ointment, and rub on this two or three times a
week, where the cause arises. A small dose of Epsom
salts will be beneficial.</p>

<p><i>Canker in the ear</i> is troublesome, particularly
with the breeds having large ears, a little alum
and water is advised as a wash for the ears, into
which it should be poured, and the flaps closed
over and rubbed gently; but I have personally found
a little "Hippacea" (procurable at most chemists),
which is a rather moist ointment, rubbed inside the affected
parts, give much relief.</p>

<p><i>Fits</i> are often caused, either by distemper or worms,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[Pg 396]</a></span>they are always alarming, particularly when they
take place away from the kennels or home, in
such case I either borrow from someone at hand,
or send for, a hamper, or box, and get the patient
home as soon as possible; as perfect quiet
and repose are very important, merely sprinkling a
little cold water on his face and placing him in some
place, with plenty of straw, or shavings, where he cannot
hurt himself by falling about, as he is quite unconscious
for the time being and not accountable for his
actions. When able to take medicine, give such treatment
as the cause of the fits require, they are usually
those I mentioned, but when caused by extreme debility,
as with an overtaxed nursing mother, they are
very serious. In any case of fits, where good professional
advice can be obtained and the patient is a pet,
or valuable, it is better not to attempt to deal with it
without.</p>

<p><i>Asthma</i> is supposed to arise from errors in feeding,
but it is certain some breeds of dogs are more
liable to it than others. Light nourishing diet, very
moderate exercise, and a little opening medicine will
certainly have a good effect, but it is a difficult complaint
to get rid of when once it makes its appearance.</p>

<p><i>Diarrhoea</i> sometimes occurs with dogs from inattention
to dietary matters, but they more often suffer from
the other extreme. A little Epsom salts in water, or
thin gruel, will often work the desired end, but if the
dog seems still in pain, ten or fifteen drops of tincture
of opium may be given in water.</p>

<p><i>Eye affections</i> are not uncommon with some breeds,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[Pg 397]</a></span>but the eye is such a tender and delicate organ to meddle with that I prefer to advise any of my readers, who
may have a patient suffering in that way, to call in the
best advice they can procure, than to give them any
directions.</p>

<p><i>Wounds</i>, whether incised or contused, are rather
awkward for a novice to deal with, and if he does so,
he had better muzzle the patient, both to prevent being
bitten and to keep the bandage, plaster or poultice
from being torn off; of course in the former case, the
affected part must be gently washed with cold water,
and the blood staunched with lint or otherwise, and if
possible tightly bandaged, and closing the edges of the
wound keep them together with sticking plaster, binding
all round with lint.</p>

<p>In <i>contused wounds</i> apply and frequently change a
bread poultice, large enough to take in all the injured
parts and keep the patient as quiet as possible, and
maintain his strength with light nourishing diet, of a
more hearty character.</p>

<p>This is not a "Kennel Guide" (although I hope
it may teach some of my readers something they
did not know in a rough and ready way) and
there are, in almost every district in the kingdom,
as I know from actual experience, having met
scores of them in the course of my doggy travels,
highly qualified gentlemen, practising as veterinary
surgeons, who have made a lifelong study of
the diseases, and calamities, to which dogs, as well as
their owners, are liable.</p>

<p>I think I have now said a little about all the many
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[Pg 398]</a></span>breeds suitable, or likely to be kept as companions or
pets, and sufficient for my book to form a <i>vade-mecum</i>,
or guide, to anyone in doubt, as to what sort of dog to
choose for the purpose, and this was the original idea
which prompted the commencement of the work.</p>

<p>The illustrations herein are from life, the subjects being
mostly typical specimens, and are introduced to
show good types of some of the least common, or
every day breeds. From the remarks often overheard
at exhibitions and elsewhere, it has greatly surprised
me how many persons have only a vague idea of
all but the most ordinary varieties.</p>

<p>Thinking over matters and things even to compile a
work of this kind, has brought back to mind many
forgotten incidents concerning both people and
animals, and I have derived much pleasure in
the course of it. I am in hopes, if the book falls into
the hands of any, who have hitherto known, or cared
nothing for dogs of any kind, they may be sufficiently
interested in my recital, of the charming qualities of so
many different varieties, to take up one or more of
them, and test the truth of my statements, which I may
say are founded on fact, and a very lengthened and
practical experience as a breeder, exhibitor and now for
many years as a judge, during which time I believe I
have kept most, and adjudicated on all, known varieties
of dogs, and on most of the breeds very often indeed.</p>

<p>And considering the many thousands of dogs, which
have come under my notice, I am bound to say, on the
whole, I have not had much to complain of, in my treatment
by the exhibitors, which have often included Her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[Pg 399]</a></span>Majesty the Queen, a well-known lover of animals, and
other members of the Royal Family, as well as leading
members of the nobility and gentry, and very many of
the middle, lower and working classes.</p>

<p>And, I hope, the reason has been that as far as lay in
my power, I have tried to serve all alike, that is, to regard
the dogs, and not their owners or leaders, as the
sole matter to be dealt with, and where exhibitors recognise
this in a judge, as a rule, his classes are well filled.</p>

<p>I think, I have said enough, in this chapter, to
justify its title, and, I hope, to form a fitting "wind-up,"
for my little work, as "All about Dogs."</p>
